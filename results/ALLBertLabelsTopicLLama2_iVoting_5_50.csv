二、提案來源

三、提案背景:
大巨蛋是綁標圖利特定財團的弊案，且BOT契約內容違法遭監察院糾正；遠雄未按圖施工且逾期未完工，有違約事實，應早日解除契約。推動台北市成為【宜居永續】的城市，應立即與遠雄解約，循法律途徑保障市民權益，收回土地重新規劃為森林運動公園:
馬市府於簽約前大幅修改原公告契約草案，BOT契約向遠雄利益傾斜，遭監察院糾正在案。 北市廉政委員會查明圖利遠雄，已將全案移送法務部與台北地檢署偵辦中。 東區精華地段10.02公頃土地，BOT給遠雄50年台北市民需負擔約200億元的土地成本利息，但不僅收不到權利金，土地租金也低到只夠讓北市府繳地價稅，反觀遠雄自估50年營收高達2,470多億元，完全不符公平正義！ 以棒球之名行商業開發之實，商業大於體育，違反都市計畫；大規模商業設施造成逃生避難空間不足。 大巨蛋將引入大量人、車潮，卻未遵守「本基地忠孝東路側應再退縮一車道」之環評審查結論，勢必嚴重衝擊周邊交通。 郝市府於2011年核發建照後，長期包庇遠雄不按圖施工，無視大巨蛋工程造成嚴重地層下陷，放任遠雄繼續施工導致古蹟及捷運板南線受損。柯市府於2015年5月勒令停工後，遠雄未於市府所訂改善期限完成改善。 2011年都審與環評時，遠雄只評估大巨蛋單棟失火的防火避難，又不實低估防災避難人數，未依環評法進行全區不同災難的逃生評估與訂定緊急應變計畫等因應對策(風災、水災、地震、爆炸、化學災害、油污染等)，更擅自刪除逃生梯造成公共安全的重大疑慮。 柯市府除都發局在公安議題上堅守底線外，其他相關局處、高層幕僚或推諉卸責，或包庇護航，做出向黑心財團妥協的選擇，嚴重違背追求公平正義的理念。提案人身為長期追蹤大巨蛋案、推動設立松菸森林公園之團體，眼看柯市府背棄信念承諾跳票，決定透過公共政策網路參與平臺進行提案，懇請台北市民共同支持。",106年04月26日,公共建設,檢核不通過,租稅、投資、人事、薪俸、特定契約個案、預算之議題，原則上不得作為提案,本案因提案內容複雜，一案多事，經與提案人溝通後，另於5月15日重新提案，故本案不進入附議。,0,提案內容複雜，一案多事,Environment & Climate," Big egg BOT The case will be terminated immediately, all information will be disclosed, and the referendum will be held after the city's administrative hearing"," 1. Proposal reasons 1.????? To promote a livable and sustainable Taipei, more parks and green spaces need to be planned 2.????? A forest sports park shared by citizens, not an expensive dome mall monopolized by consortiums 3.????? Dismantling Corrupt Landmarks for Transformational Justice4.????? Earthwork should be backfilled in the limited construction area of the Big Arena MRT to ensure the safety of the Bannan Line 5.????? Failure to withdraw the lane according to the conclusion of the EIA will become a cancerous traffic knot in the East District 6.????? Major doubts about disaster prevention and evacuation, the tragedy of the Eight Immortals cannot be repeated 7.????? The development of business is greater than sports, which violates the urban planning law 8.????? Continuing the construction of Farglory with zero royalties for 50 years, taking back the self-operated business will also benefit the people 9.????? Guaranteed purchase terms after completion to kidnap Taipei for 50 years, the contract should be terminated as soon as possible 10.? Leaving a fair, just, livable and sustainable Taipei for the next generation II. Proposal source Songyan Park Birth Alliance, Songyan Tree Protection Volunteer Group, Taiwan Savage Heart Foot Ecological Association, Taiwan Tree Protection Group Alliance III. Proposal Background : The big dome is a fraudulent case of tying a label to benefit a specific consortium, and BOTThe content of the contract was illegal and was corrected by the Supervisory Yuan; Farglory did not construct according to the plan and was not completed within the time limit. If there is a breach of contract, the contract should be terminated as soon as possible. To promote Taipei City to become a [livable and sustainable] city, the contract with Farglory should be terminated immediately, citizens' rights and interests should be protected through legal channels, and the land should be recovered and re-planned as a forest sports park : The Mashi government substantially revised the original draft of the announced contract before signing the contract. BOT The contract was tilted towards the interests of Farglory, which was corrected by the Overwatch Council. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Integrity has found Farglory to be profiting, and has transferred the entire case to the Ministry of Justice and the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The best location in the East District 10.02 hectares of land, BOT to farglory 50 Taipei citizens need to pay about 200 100 million yuan in land cost and interest, but not only did not receive the royalties, but the land rent was only low enough for the Beishi government to pay the land value tax. On the other hand, Farglory estimated 50 Annual revenue up to 2,470More than 100 million yuan is completely inconsistent with fairness and justice! Commercial development in the name of baseball means that business is greater than sports, which violates urban planning; large-scale commercial facilities result in insufficient space for escape and refuge. The stadium will attract a large number of people and traffic, but it does not comply with the EIA review conclusion that ""the side of Zhongxiao East Road in this base should be retreated by one more lane"", which will seriously impact the surrounding traffic. Hao Shifu Yu 2011 After the approval and issuance of construction permits in 2010, they have long shielded Farglory for not constructing according to the plans, ignored the Big Egg Project and caused serious ground subsidence, and allowed Farglory to continue construction, causing damage to historic sites and the Bannan Line of the MRT. Cuomo City 2015 Year 5 After the shutdown was ordered in July, Farglory failed to complete the improvement within the improvement deadline set by the city government. 2011 During the annual metropolitan review and EIA, Farglory only evaluated the fire prevention and evacuation of a single building in the Big Arena, and falsely underestimated the number of people evacuated for disaster prevention. It did not conduct an evacuation assessment of different disasters in the whole region and formulate an emergency response plan in accordance with the EIA law. Countermeasures ( Wind disasters, floods, earthquakes, explosions, chemical disasters, oil pollution, etc. ) Deleting the escape ladder without authorization caused major doubts about public safety. In addition to the Metropolitan Development Bureau's sticking to the bottom line on public security issues, other relevant bureaus and high-level staff either shirk their responsibilities, or cover up escorts, and make the choice to compromise with black-hearted financial groups, which seriously violates the concept of pursuing fairness and justice. The proposer is a group that has been following the Big Egg case for a long time and promoting the establishment of Songyan Forest Park.

26,Traffic Management in Zhongshan North Road,27,2017-05-22,交通改善提議：新生南路公車專用道向最內側車道遷移,"依照臺北市政府原先規劃，新生南路段的公車專用道原應比照松江路公車專用道設置於最內側車道，但由於捷運新莊蘆洲線施工而暫時設置於外側第二車道。在捷運竣工後，市政府原先有意恢復原本設置，然而因為地方人士反對而將暫時規劃的公車專用道保留至今。然而幾年下來，用路人不難發現這個規劃存在一個明顯而嚴重的問題，那就是最內側(禁行機車、僅供四輪車以上行駛)兩車道經常處於空曠狀態，而同時被公車專用道分隔的最外側車道卻經常處於壅塞狀態。這個狀況造成的問題主要是外側車道用路人的極大不便，包括機車使用者和右轉的小客車使用者。
機車使用者佔臺北市用路族群相當大一部分，在本路段的交通流量的佔比也毫不例外。根據附圖顯示的台北交通流量調查，在新生南路南北向(B,D方向)的機車族群依路段、時段不同，約佔總交通流量的60%~70%左右，可以說是絕對多數。
然而
(1) 現行公車專用道加上內側兩車道禁行機車的設計，卻使得這個佔比絕對多數的用路族群僅能使用外側的一車道，這個車道的寬度僅可容納一輛半的自小客車，相對於這佔比60%~70%的交通量已是相當侷促，並且本車道是混流車道，機車使用者和小客車使用者必須分享這個車道的空間。
(2)再加上沿線鄰近金華國中與新生國小和眾多商家，家長接送、計程車、貨車裝卸等都使得臨時停車甚至是違法停車不斷出現，更讓機車使用者實際上可使用的空間變得十分零碎。
(3)沿線巷道匯入的車流更將這段外側車道的容納力逼到極限，一旦有車從旁匯入，本車道的車流勢必只能減速，造成車速遲滯。
可以說當前的規劃是逼迫60%以上的用路者分享本段道路25%以下的面積，而且不是完整路幅，是與違停、右轉汽車夾雜的畸零空間，經常使用本段外側的用路人，絕對能感受到不論時段的壅塞與不便。
有些質疑的觀點可能認為，機車體積較小，因此比較小的面積應該不至於造成麻煩，然而在這樣總面積狹小並畸零的狀況下，佔比多數的機車使用者實際上已經明顯感受到不便，通勤時間延長、道路風險也隨著車道狀況而顯著提高，這是不爭的事實。
對於想要在本路段任一路口右轉的小客車而言有類似的問題，想要右轉的小客車，在到達目標路口之前必須與佔總交通量60%~70%的機車共享只剩一車道的狹小空間，大量違停、計程車臨停、隨機從巷道匯入的車流都讓使用這個車道的小客車使用者明顯承受不便，到達目標路口後的右轉更可能與直行機車發生意外，險象環生。因此這個規劃對於新生南路主要的兩個使用族群都是相當不友善的。
要解決這個問題，只能透過回歸原本交通規劃，讓公車專用道遷移至最內側車道，並且公車專用道外側空間不再禁行機車，才能還給新生南路用路人(特別是佔多數的機車使用者)合理的使用空間，若仍然禁行機車，對機車使用者而言根本沒有解決分配不足的問題。當然，支持既有設置的部分該區居民的意見，政府應該給出相應的尊重，然而道路的規劃涉及的絕不只是該區居民的主觀感受，更有客觀上公眾交通的效益需要考慮，唯有將多數用路者的效益和感受納入規劃的考量，才可能使得道路規劃符合實際需求。
這個提案試圖藉由連署，使市政府正視廣大用路族群長年以來的不便，並向決策者顯示支持規劃變更的民意。基於以上陳述的理由，籲請所有北市用路人的支持。

?",106年05月22日,交通運輸,附議不通過,附議不通過(未達3000則),,209,附議不通過(未達3000則),Transport, Traffic Improvement Proposal: Xinsheng South Road Bus Lane Moved to the Innermost Lane," According to the original plan of the Taipei City Government, the bus lane on the Xinsheng South Road section should have been set in the innermost lane like the Songjiang Road bus lane, but it was temporarily set in the second lane on the outer side due to the construction of the MRT Xinzhuang-Luzhou Line. After the completion of the MRT, the city government originally intended to restore the original setting. However, due to the opposition of local people, the temporarily planned bus lanes have been retained until now. However, after a few years, it is not difficult for passers-by to find that there is an obvious and serious problem in this plan, that is, the innermost ( Motorcycles are prohibited, only for four-wheeled vehicles and above )The two lanes are often in an empty state, while the outermost lane separated by the bus lane is often in a congested state. The problem caused by this situation is mainly the great inconvenience for passers-by of the outer lane, including motor vehicle users and small passenger car users turning right. Motorcycle users account for a considerable part of the road users in Taipei City, and the proportion of traffic flow on this road section is no exception. According to the traffic flow survey in Taipei shown in the attached picture, in the north-south direction of Xinsheng South Road (B,D direction ) According to different road sections and time periods, the locomotive groups account for about 10% of the total traffic flow. 60%~70% Left and right, it can be said to be an absolute majority. However (1) The current bus-only lane and the design of the inner two lanes forbidding locomotives make it possible for this overwhelming majority of road users to use only the outer lane. The width of this lane can only accommodate one and a half small passenger cars. in this proportion 60%~70% The traffic volume is already quite cramped, and this lane is a mixed-flow lane, and locomotive users and passenger car users must share the space of this lane. (2)Coupled with the proximity of Jinhua Junior High School, Xinsheng Elementary School and many businesses along the line, parents pick-up, taxis, truck loading and unloading, etc. all make temporary parking and even illegal parking, which makes the space that motorcycle users can actually use very fragmented. . (3) The incoming traffic flow along the roadway pushes the capacity of this outer lane to the limit. Once a car merges in from the side, the traffic flow in this lane will have to slow down, causing the speed to lag. It can be said that the current plan is to force 60% The above road users share this road 25%The area below, and not the complete road width, is a distorted space mixed with illegally parked and right-turning cars. Passers-by who often use the outside of this section will definitely feel the congestion and inconvenience no matter the time of day. Some skeptical views may think that the small size of the motorcycle should not cause trouble. However, in such a small and distorted total area, the majority of motorcycle users have actually felt the inconvenience. It is an indisputable fact that commute times are longer and road risk increases significantly with lane conditions. There is a similar problem for the passenger car that wants to turn right at any intersection of this road segment. The passenger car that wants to turn right must meet the total traffic volume before reaching the target intersection 60%~70%The locomotives share a small space with only one lane left. A large number of illegal parking, temporary parking of taxis, and random traffic flow from the roadway all cause obvious inconvenience to the small passenger car users using this lane. Turning right after reaching the target intersection is more likely to be different from the traffic flow. There was an accident on the straight locomotive, and there was a lot of danger. Therefore, this plan is quite unfriendly to the two main user groups of Xinsheng South Road. To solve this problem, only by returning to the original traffic planning, the bus-only lane is moved to the innermost lane, and the outer space of the bus-only lane is no longer prohibited for motorcycles, so that the pedestrians on Xinsheng South Road can be returned ( Especially the majority of motorcycle users )Reasonable use of space, if the locomotives are still prohibited, the problem of insufficient allocation will not be solved for the locomotive users at all. Of course, the government should give corresponding respect to the opinions of some residents in the area who support the existing installations. However, the road planning involves not only the subjective feelings of the residents in the area, but also the objective benefits of public transportation that need to be considered. Only by taking into account the benefits and feelings of most road users into the planning can the road planning meet the actual needs. This proposal attempts to make the city government face up to the long-term inconvenience of the majority of road users through joint signatures, and show decision makers that they support the planning change. Based on the reasons stated above, we appeal to the support of all passers-by in Beishi. ??", 106 Year 05 moon twenty two day, Transportation, Seconded not passed, Seconded not passed ( not reached 3000 but ),,209, Seconded not passed ( not reached 3000 but ), Transport,,,,,,,Transport

　　因臺北市現有公園罐頭化，孩子很喜歡盪鞦韆，但查詢臺北市政府開放資料平台-臺北市公園設施(資料更新日期：2017-03-14 )，轄內300多處公園僅有25處有盪鞦韆可供玩耍，故得知「臺北鄰里公園翻轉計畫」中有設置「市民秋千實驗基地」非常的開心及期待。
?
二、緣由：
　　昨日帶著孩子前往朝聖，發現現場空無一人，覺得非常驚訝，但帶著孩子玩耍約半小時後，我能理解為何這麼棒的設施卻閒置的理由，故希望藉由市民的力量一起改變這現狀，也讓設施能有更佳的推廣及利用！
?
理由1：地點位於台北市安東街與市民大道交叉口旁（市民大道三段高架橋下），帶著孩子出門通常都大包小包，此地點停車或搭乘大眾捷運都不是很方便，正值酷暑，帶著孩子抵?就已是一大苦差事。
理由2：地板無設置軟墊及防護措施，感覺僅是將器材架上該處，卻完全未設想到安全性的問題，孩子跑跳時非常容易受傷，故完全無法放手安心讓孩子自己玩。
理由3：設置地點前方為捷運廢氣排出口，二個大人在該處不到30分鐘皆覺頭暈，孩子臉也一直紅通通，但孩子顧玩也不會在乎身體是否不適，故希請慎重考量更換設置地點。",106年07月17日,區里事務、文化藝術與資產,檢核不通過,行政機關已對提案內容有既定政策規劃，且不適合依提案內容調整,有關「市民秋千實驗基地」係本府文化局2016年「國際設計合作計畫」獲選團隊之一都市酵母與西班牙設計團隊 basurama 攜手合作，打造「臺北鄰里公園翻轉實驗計畫」，主要透過廢棄物重生，荒廢空間變身遊樂場，喚起大家重視空間活化議題，地點受到鄰里支持，凝聚在地情感，且全案為實驗性計畫，經考量場地適用性，展期至2017年底，非屬固定式遊具，故不開放附議。,0,全案為實驗性計畫，經考量場地適用性，展期至2017年底，非屬固定式遊具，故不開放附議,Social ," Please relocate the location of ""Citizen Swing Experiment Base"""," 1.

二、LG05站命名歷史
民國101年4月6日，永和區公所召開車站命名會議，會議結論以「宗教博物館站」、「仁愛公園站」、「永平國小站」為建議名稱，並提報捷運工程局評審小組審議。 民國104年12月28日站體動工，於永平國小大門口保平路正上方及地下施工。 民國106年7月11日，LG05車站命名為永和站。
三、「永和站」站體命名未符合台北市捷運車站命名要點
以「永和站」為站體命名，之於LG05站之地方辨識性及代表性、意義性，深感不足且未能代表捷運站所在位址之地理意義。 「永和」一詞，未具有LG05站的地方辨識性，永和以中正橋往永和方向延伸永和路劃分東、西兩區域，「永和」一詞未能代表LG05站所在之地理意義及地區辨識性。 永和現有之捷運站「永安市場」站，命名與所在地之永安市場距離半徑500公尺範圍內，符合命名原則之要點二。何以LG05站之命名卻未依據此原則？LG05站體半徑500公尺涵括永和區保平里、和平里、保安里、保順里、協和里及中和區佳和里、瓦?里，不僅是涵括永和還包含中和區。本站體命名討論過程缺乏捷運站體在地居民之民意基礎。
四、綜上所述，在此請求臺北市政府之事項如下
公開LG05站「捷運車站命名、更名或車站站名加註評審小組」審查會議紀錄，以便民眾了解LG05站之站名審議過程及決策考量。 依據〈臺北市臺北都會區大眾捷運系統捷運車站命名更名或車站站名加註名稱作業要點〉第二點捷運車站之命名程序第六項之規定，由台北市捷運局召開臨時會議，給予站體所在地民眾命名「萬大線LG05站」之參與權。 依據〈臺北市臺北都會區大眾捷運系統捷運車站命名更名或車站站名加註名稱作業要點〉第三點捷運車站之更名規定，辨識性不足者，得辦理更名。制定LG05周邊民眾參與命名機制及公開透明命名過程、決策過程，落實開放政府、民眾參與民主之落實。 附近公車站「保生路口」站及站體位置離LG05站體相距不遠，公車站牌「保生路口」站與捷運站名「永和」站兩站名難以連結，不利觀光民眾理解及轉乘辨識。

84,Traffic Management in Zhongshan North Road,85,2017-09-06,爭取試辦中山北路雙向一至三段內側塗銷一道禁行機車,"? 民國77年的機車數量為8,426,868台，至今日106年機車數量已經到達21,614,728 台。搭配機車密度的統計數字，每百人擁有機車數量來看，從當時民國77年的42.2台/百人，到今日91.8台/百人。不同的條件之下，同樣的法令竟能延續至今，我覺得不行。為了廣大機車通勤族的用路安全，主管機關勢必要有改善作為。
? 首先，中山北路外側車道只有二線道，機車因為禁行內側二車道的緣故，機車騎士每天被迫要面對的狀況如下:各路公車靠站離站時的左彎右切、計程車 or 自小客車臨時上下客、路邊違停車輛，路邊並排違停車輛、內側車道匯入外側車道的車輛 or 外側匯入內側等等...... 這麼危險的用路環境也導致了中山北路是台北市車禍死亡率最高的路段。同樣有部分二線道的市民大道公車數量便少了許多，但公車數量非本在提案所討論範疇內，僅作為比較用途。
? 第二，道路使用的合理性，尖峰時段常見外側二車道擠的水洩不通，內側道路相較之下順暢許多。以我為例:每日通勤路段為中山北路一段至五段，中間無須轉彎，照理說可以於最內側安全直行至目的地，但是在現行惡劣環境下，卻被迫要沒效率的塞在公車後面以及隨時提防右轉車輛剪線。這樣明顯的不合邏輯，為何直行車會被右轉車及臨停車擋住?
? 防衛駕駛觀念薄弱的族群大多數為:剛取得機車駕照年輕人及上了年紀的老人家，交通政策卻給他們一個高風險的用路環境。每每新聞所見交通意外，年輕生命隕落、家中長輩車禍去世，這些車禍悲劇確實可以透過修改惡法而降低發生機率。
? 道路使用者有責任遵守交通法規，政策制定者同樣也有責任要提供用路人一個安全的行車環境。
?
註:本市設置「禁行機車」道係依「道路交通安全規則」第99條規定，於三車道以上單行道路之內側車道佈設「禁行機車」，並提供最外側2車道供機車通行，以減少汽、機車混流交織，提昇交通安全。考量市區道路因鄰街活動及大型車（公車）停靠等因素干擾機車合理行駛空間，並以行車安全為最高原則，爰本市後續仍以個案檢討開放外側第3車道禁行機車，以提供機車合理行駛空間。
??",106年09月06日,交通運輸,附議不通過,附議不通過(未達3000則),,635,附議不通過(未達3000則),Transport, Strive for the pilot implementation of a ban on locomotives on the inner side of the first to third sections of the two-way section of Zhongshan North Road," ? Republic of China 77 The number of locomotives per year is 8,426,868 Taiwan, to this day 106 The annual number of locomotives has reached 21,614,728 tower. Combined with the statistics of locomotive density, the number of locomotives per 100 people, from the time of the Republic of China 77 Year 42.2 tower / Hundreds of people, to this day 91.8 tower /Hundreds of people. Under different conditions, the same law can continue to this day, I don't think it is possible. For the safety of the roads used by the vast number of locomotive commuters, the competent authorities must make improvements. ? First of all, there are only two-lane lanes on the outer lane of Zhongshan North Road. Motorcycle riders are forced to face the following situations every day because motorcycles are prohibited from using the inner two-lane lane : Turn left and cut right when buses of all roads stop and leave the station, taxis or Temporary loading and unloading of passengers from passenger cars, illegally parked vehicles on the roadside, illegally parked vehicles side by side on the roadside, and vehicles that merge from the inner lane to the outer lane or Outside merges into inside, etc. … Such a dangerous road environment has also led to Zhongshan North Road being the section with the highest traffic accident fatality rate in Taipei City. Similarly, the number of buses on Civic Avenue on some second-lane roads is much smaller, but the number of buses is not included in the scope of the proposal and is only for comparison purposes. ? Second, the rationality of road use. During peak hours, the outer two lanes are often crowded, while the inner road is much smoother. take me as an example :The daily commuting section is from Section 1 to Section 5 of Zhongshan North Road. There is no need to turn in the middle. It is reasonable to say that you can go straight to your destination safely on the innermost side. However, under the current harsh environment, you are forced to jam behind the bus inefficiently and be on guard at all times. Turn right and the vehicle cuts the line.

以芝山國小為中心點，周邊幾乎都是將近三十年左右的老房子，早期房子並無考輛汽車機車的停放，所以幾乎都沒有車位。加上最近公有停車場在台北市立大學，距離芝山國小這附近居民較遠，多數人承租意願不高。
規劃芝山國小停車場好處
1.現行芝山國小周邊居住人口與市立大學周邊相比較多，周圍停放汽機車也相對較多，可減少周邊鄰亂的危停以及人行單的寬廣。
2.德行東路行駛公車(280/206/紅15)相當大台，如規畫芝山國小停車場，可減少公車會車困難，以及行車安全。
3.增加國小土地的活化，現行少子化因素導致現行國小全校人口不到五百人，設立停車場也可設立活動中心泳游池等，增加學生來讀意願，活化週邊土地。
4.德行東路383巷停滿汽車，士東路巷子周邊，假使清空巷道如遇到失火可加滅火或是一些零星的救援。

【重磅快評】被謝志偉改名的台灣 台獨是否依舊？
2017-10-24 15:36聯合報 主筆室
?
今年國慶駐德代表謝志偉把「中華民國」的德文改成「一個民主實體」，讓台灣繼中華民國、中華台北之外，又多了一個「國號」，只是這個國號，失去了她的名字，而沒有名字的國家，就猶如一個失根的蘭花。
?
其實，從台獨的史觀中，台灣從來就不是一個國家，而只是一個政治實體，一個被中華民國佔領七十年的政治實體，而現在這個政治實體，被謝志偉詮釋成是一個民主實體，只是這個民主實體，是從中華民國流亡到台灣的政治實體，還是大日本帝國統治下的政治實體？
?
其實，以台獨為終生志業的謝志偉，應該勇敢地把它翻成「台灣國」國慶，只是現在卻反而倒退成一個沒名的「民主實體」，也許從謝志偉的角度來看，玫瑰花即使失去了名字，仍然不失它的芬芳，國號失去了「台灣」，仍然不脫台獨的本質。
?
但從現場的布條來看，中文是「中華民國國慶」，而德文是「一個民主實體的生日」，由此可見，謝志偉的民主實體是給德國人看的，只是看到的德國人大概會很驚訝，既只是一個「民主實體」，那為何會有「國」慶？而不敢光明正大的把「台灣」寫出來，又要如何獨立建國呢？由此可見，台獨人士的矛盾心態。
?
自從去年民進黨上台以來，便陸續出現許多光怪陸離的去中國化、去國旗化措施，而現在又多了「去國家化」，只是身為第一線的中華民國大使，卻公然把台灣看成是一個民主實體，外交部卻是極為的袒護，也未見總統府有任何的譴責，而外交部說現場有掛國旗，沒有矮化的問題，這是粉飾太平的推託之詞。這也難怪，大陸一直在懷疑蔡英文政府一方面強調維持現狀，一方面卻進行法理台獨。
?
如果玫瑰不叫玫瑰，芬芳是否依舊？那本文到要問：如果台灣不叫台灣，而台獨是否依舊？

It makes the people of the Republic of China feel incredible! Those political officials who are required to receive the salary of the Republic of China, who do not respect or value the Republic of China, will be removed from office immediately. 1. During the 106th National Day activities of the Republic of China this year, ""de-nationalization of the Republic of China"" was carried out. On the invitation letters for National Day activities of various embassies abroad, the country name and national flag of the Republic of China are removed. 2. The national flag disappeared after the revision of the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is even more malicious. 3. In the National Day tea party held by German representative offices abroad, the country name ""Republic of China"" disappeared, and the nondescript practice of writing ""democratic entity"" in German has completely degraded itself and lost its national dignity. ? ? News link source: https://udn.com/news/story/6656/2775679 [Heavy Quick Review] Is Taiwan independence, which was renamed by Xie Zhiwei, still? 2017-10-24 15:36 Lianhe Daily Chief Writer’s Office? This year’s National Day representative in Germany, Xie Zhiwei, changed the German word for “Republic of China” to “a democratic entity”, giving Taiwan another one besides the Republic of China and Chinese Taipei. ""National title"" is just this country's title, which has lost its name, and a country without a name is like an orchid that has lost its roots. ? In fact, from the historical perspective of Taiwan independence, Taiwan has never been a country, but only a political entity, a political entity occupied by the Republic of China for 70 years, and now this political entity is interpreted by Xie Zhiwei as a democratic entity. It's just that this democratic entity is a political entity exiled from the Republic of China to Taiwan, or a political entity under the rule of the Great Japanese Empire? ? In fact, Hsieh Chi-wei, who took Taiwan independence as his lifelong career, should have bravely translated it into ""Taiwan's National Day"", but now it has regressed into an unnamed ""democratic entity"". Perhaps from Hsieh's point of view, roses Even if it loses its name, it still does not lose its fragrance. Even if the title of the country loses ""Taiwan"", it still does not lose its essence of Taiwan independence. But judging from the posters on the scene, the Chinese is ""National Day of the Republic of China"", while the German is ""the birthday of a democratic entity"". From this, it can be seen that Xie Zhiwei's democratic entity is for the Germans, but only for the Germans. People will probably be surprised, since it is only a ""democratic entity"", why is there a ""National"" Day? And dare not write ""Taiwan"" openly, how can we build an independent country? This shows the ambivalence of Taiwan independence advocates. ? Since the Democratic Progressive Party came to power last year, there have been many bizarre measures to de-Sinicize and de-nationalize the national flag. Now there are more ""de-nationalization"". It is regarded as a democratic entity, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely protective, and has not seen any condemnation from the presidential palace. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that there is a national flag on the scene, and there is no problem of dwarfing. This is an excuse to whitewash the peace. It is no wonder that the mainland has always suspected that Tsai Ing-wen's government, while emphasizing maintaining the status quo, is pursuing de jure Taiwan independence. ? If the rose is not called a rose, is the fragrance still there?

It can be seen that the injury should not be serious. There is a sign on Yongfu Bridge that prohibits pedestrians from using the motor vehicle lane, but many people can’t ride on it at all, and insist on using the motor vehicle lane.

We should review whether the design of the bicycle lanes on the bridge is not convenient enough, causing a lot of people to risk going on the lanes.

?
依據公告的「台北市106學年度公立幼兒園收費基準」5歲就讀幼兒園的一學期$7000、雜費$2955及5個月的活動費$230*5、材料費$345*5，共$12830皆由台北市教育局負擔；反觀就讀私立幼兒園的補助金額卻依家戶所得不同補助每學期補助新臺幣2,543元至1萬2,543元不等。
?
如果以5歲入學學費全補助的觀點來看，應該不論公私立幼兒園都補助$12543或$12830，不該依家戶所得而有分別；因為公立幼兒園已經有政府補助辦園經費，所以家長要負擔的學費已經相較於私立幼兒園少很多，所有費用合計，以一學期五個月來估算的話，公幼平均月支出$4576；但台北市的私立幼兒園卻都是$15000~$25000甚至更多，無法念到公立幼兒園必須轉念私立幼兒園的家長負擔已經足足比公立幼兒園每個月多了$10,000(含)以上甚至更多。
?
而公立幼兒園的5歲就學補助，是不論家庭所得級距為何，都可享有高達$12830的補助；私立幼兒園卻因家戶所得差距有$2543到1萬2543元的差距，事實上，不論家戶所得差距皆可去抽公立幼兒園。更遑論公立幼兒園在補助低收入戶、清貧家庭入學後，還有一個同校教職人員子女優先的順位，剩下的名額才給一般家庭去抽。
?
建議請齊一公私立幼兒園的五歲入學補助金額，不論家戶所得、不分公私立幼兒園，統一5歲入學補助標準。取消私立幼兒園必須再依家戶所得級距有不同補助金額，不論公、私立幼兒園5歲入學補助金額應一致。",106年11月17日,教育及體育,附議不通過,附議不通過(未達3000則),,0,附議不通過(未達3000則),, 5 Entrance subsidies for children under 10 years old who attend private kindergartens should be the same amount as those who attend public kindergartens," The content of the current ""School Subsidy for Young Children"" is as follows: ""School-age children registered in Taipei City 5 Subsidy for school expenses for children under 10 years old: those who attend public kindergartens will receive a subsidy of NT$ per semester5,543 Yuan (full-time class) or New Taiwan dollars 3,235 NT$ (half-day class); those who attend private kindergartens will be subsidized NT$ per semester according to the total income of the household 2,543 yuan to 1 Ten thousand 2,543 Yuan varies.

1. 各個區民前往菜市場理論上為步行即可到達的距離，如果距離不方便可以騎乘單車進入，進去市場後改為下車推腳踏車。如需要載送購買物品，還是可以帶手推車。
2. 原本已經不夠寬廣的路面已經有攤販, 行人, 嬰兒推車, 菜籃車, 腳踏車。機車在菜市場的路面上移動，會讓其他逛街人士不停地閃躲它，讓已經很壅擠的市場，增加更多行的困難。

在我所知有半數以上的台灣人認為執行應用程式設計或遊戲腳本，角色設計等利用電腦操作的行為，定義為玩電腦。
常常聽的到一句話""不要再玩電腦了，趕快去認真讀書比較實在。""
但是在這個全球化的時代，讀書讀到大學畢業，碩士，博士出來又有什麼用意呢?
有多少人不是每天耗在手機電腦上，上著Facebook，LINE，Twitter等社交軟體。與瀏覽Yahoo，Google等搜尋引擎，看著蘋果日報，自由時報等新聞媒體。
?
在我所知有半數以上的台灣學子在就讀高中國中時，必須強迫參加夜間輔導，暑假輔導，寒假輔導，即使他們不願意。
我在想這些時間是否就可以足夠用來作為其他課外的休憩娛樂。
學子們想要的到底是要讀書，還是休息? 應該由他們自己選擇。而不是因為大人繳了錢他們就要去。
?
試想，如果有一間大學的電子遊戲設計系，需要的是軟體專才，那你再讀多少書又有什麼用?
如果說未來的工作不是興趣，那在高中國中時適時將興趣結合工作，那是否可能扭轉一個小孩的未來?

二、計畫發想：
1.????????? 全安里的人口組成
全安里的居民組成中，在65歲以上的居民共993人佔全安里人口的21.8%，從數字上可見全安里已經超越高齡化，甚至已達到高齡社會20%的標準。其中不乏有許多行動不便、拄拐杖，或乘坐輪椅的長輩。0-4歲的人數有197人，有一定的嬰兒車、娃娃車使用量。(資料來源：台北市大安區戶政事務所)
2.????????? 樂利路的路況
在兩旁的人行道上，從馬路柏油路面到店家之間可能需要二到三階的高度差。這樣的路況對於輪椅的使用者、推嬰兒車、拉菜籃的人來說是一種不便與潛在的危險。
綜合上述兩點所考量的，希望能夠將從騎樓到路面的高度統一，除了營造更友善的空間、增進實用性，也增加道路整體的美觀。

D.??????? 樂利路上有便利商店，補足超市營業時間限制上不足 (D圈起處)
E.???????? 通往幼兒園的重要通道 (E圈起處)

B.???????? 店家出入口有新增台階
C.???????? 社區門口到馬路面也有許多階梯差
?
?
3.????????? 不改善可能造成的問題
A.??????? 對社區內輪椅使用者、行動不便、長輩，或家裡有用嬰兒車、菜籃的爸爸媽媽而言會造成出入困難不便。
B.???????? 有許多店家是行動較不便的人無法進入的，或會造成有推菜籃嬰兒車的人進出麻煩。
C.???????? 要走進騎樓就必須往上一階，對上述族群而言就只能在騎樓外的人行道上通行，若遇雨天則無遮蔽；若露天人行道上有阻擋物或不易進入的話甚至必須與車爭道，容易發生危險。

1. 為來台北市旅遊觀光的旅客，提供一個更便利、更體貼的服務
2. 台北市中心僅有的大客車臨停上下客停車位少之又少，為讓乘客方便下車，只有違規紅線停靠，常常險象環生，從客人下了車以後，再來的就是要跟警察玩貓抓老鼠，警察來我們就開走，龐大的車體，大CC數的廢氣排放，在台北市中心繞呀繞呀！不但空汙率提升，更影響路上行車安全！
應該很少人知道大部份的遊覽車駕駛尿尿都是在車上隱密處，用空寶特瓶來完成，在這過程心中忐忑不安，小心翼翼，還要左顧右盼深怕路人看見，或乘客突然回來了，更怕警察來開單！
吃飯除非是團客，旅行社有訂餐廳，餐廳提供便當，客人下車，餐廳立刻遞上，再找個地方停車、解決，還是一樣要左顧右盼，囫圇吞棗來完成，深怕警察來開單，所停的地方也是路邊也防害交通！黃線還好，只要車發動著，人在車上，警察通常不理你，但怠速排放的空氣污染何等嚇人！
這陣子遊覽車意外事故頻傳在交通部、觀光局祭出多項罰則，也不見改善，我認為要從根本做起！
為駕駛一個有人性基本需求的工作環境，一個平等的待遇，讓遊覽車駕駛有精神上的活力。
安心的停車，好好的吃完便當，可以下車走走去上廁所！很難嗎 ?
路邊小車停車格到處都是，卻沒有大車停車格，與其寧願空在那裡，倒不如給遊覽車一個方便，給旅客一個安全，讓駕駛可以吃飽飯、上廁所，車上閉目休息。

　　因課業需求多次參訪法治里，常會在法治公園的涼亭處停留討論，發現大部分成員被蚊子叮咬的次數較多，這也引發我們對公園蚊蟲問題進行進一步的探討。我們對法治公園的蚊蟲數量進行了初步的調查小實驗，買黏蚊板並放置在公園的各處當實驗組，而對照組則是挑選位於臺北醫學大學拇山宿舍旁的一個小公園進行對比分析，放置的時間都是固定在中午，測試時間為四十分鐘，初步實驗發現，法治公園涼亭處所放置的黏蚊板上，沾黏的蚊蟲較其他放置處多。
?
貳、現狀分析
　　根據目前我們的瞭解，法治公園整體上的乾淨整潔，有以下因素：
　　一、里長動員法治里內的里民幫忙
　　二、社區志工自發性清掃
　　三、市政府的環保局派人定期清潔
　　然而在法治公園涼亭處，我們仍發現存在數量不少的蚊子和蒼蠅，除了此處外，公園內其他的角落蚊蟲較少。我們也有訪問在公園休憩的里民，有人亦提到他們認為公園的蚊蟲較多的問題。此涼亭周遭應該是公園環境整治中的漏網之魚，在我們的小實驗中，公園內的水池、水溝等蚊蟲數量並沒有涼亭多，而我們所建立防蚊蟲的措施中，涼亭處是要加強的重點。

This also triggered our further research on the problem of mosquitoes in the park. discussion. We conducted a preliminary small experiment to investigate the number of mosquitoes in the rule of law park. We bought sticky mosquito panels and placed them in various places in the park as the experimental group, while the control group selected a small park next to the Mushan dormitory of Taipei Medical University for comparison. According to the analysis, the placement time is fixed at noon, and the test time is 40 minutes. Preliminary experiments have found that the sticky mosquito panels placed in the gazebo of the rule of law park have more mosquitoes than other places. 2. Analysis of the current situation According to our current understanding, the overall cleanliness of the rule of law park has the following factors: 1. The village chief mobilized the residents in the rule of law to help 2. Community volunteers spontaneously cleaned up 3. The environmental protection bureau of the municipal government We send people to clean it regularly. However, we still found a lot of mosquitoes and flies at the gazebo in the rule of law park. Except here, there are fewer mosquitoes in other corners of the park. We also interviewed residents who rest in the park, and some people also mentioned that they think the park has more mosquitoes. The surrounding area of this gazebo should be the fish that slipped through the net in the environmental improvement of the park. In our small experiment, the number of mosquitoes in the pools and ditches in the park is not as large as that of the gazebo.

位於大安區的法治里，是一個典型的住宅型社區，餐廳小吃林立，生活機能完備。方便之餘，近期有里民反應，住戶周邊的巷弄充滿餐飲排放的油煙味，進而影響居住環境和空氣品質。
目前仍舊是有大量的店家沒有完善處理排煙問題。店家使用排油煙機，但是只把廚房的油煙排出店外，只有店裡面是沒有味道的。鄰近大馬路的店家是直接排到大馬路，可能是因為馬路本身足夠寬大，加上大馬路上汽機車數量多，本身也會排煙，所以除非直臨排氣口，不然，味道沒有像在小巷子裡面的店家重。
?在小巷子裡面的店家，店家相聚很近，在小巷子沒有足夠的空間和空氣流動去減輕油煙的味道。有一些是選擇在後方防火巷進行排煙，但是部分的排煙管線老舊跟外表有明顯破碎，導出的油煙直接接在大型垃圾桶中，而大型垃圾桶是沒有密封起來的，所以這樣的排煙設施基本無用。有一家便當店是將油煙排至下水溝，但是管線和下水溝接合處沒有完整密封起來，味道直接擴散到旁邊。比方說早餐店是直接在煎炒早餐的地方直接用小風扇排到外面，在遠遠的地方就能聞到早餐的味道。
主要問題及其嚴重性 據統計，肺癌已成為台灣癌症排行之首，排除吸菸之暴露因子，盛行全球的公衛議題--空氣污染，近年率先成為主要導因。相較於其他縣市，台北市為高度發展的都市，人口稠密，相對難以控制餐廳油煙騎車輛廢氣排放量。參考先前政府全面宣導的無菸餐廳，禁止公共場所吸菸，對於餐廳的油煙排放設備，應加以控管，從社區著手加強稽查管制，再根據實行的成效，擴大範圍，提升國民居住品質。",106年12月10日,環保生態,檢核不通過,提案內容屬理念推廣建議，不易進行議題討論及投票,i-Voting為一網路投票機制，本案提案內容增加不定期抽查排油煙情形及補助10%設施費用之興革建議，不易進行議題討論、選項擬訂與投票，非屬i-Voting提案內容，故不開放附議。,0,提案內容增加不定期抽查排油煙情形及補助10%設施費用之興革建議，不易進行議題討論、選項擬訂與投票，非屬i-Voting提案內容。,," The restaurant has no oil fume and is healthy every day - Oil fume emission improvement plan in Fazhili, Daan District","Situation Analysis Located in Fazhili, Daan District, it is a typical residential community with restaurants and snacks everywhere and complete living functions. In addition to convenience, residents have recently reported that the alleys around the residents are filled with the smell of cooking fumes, which in turn affects the living environment and air quality. At present, there are still a large number of stores that have not fully dealt with the smoke exhaust problem. The store uses a range hood, but only the fume from the kitchen is discharged outside the store, only the inside of the store has no smell. The shops adjacent to the main road are directly discharged to the main road. It may be because the road itself is wide enough, and there are a lot of cars and motorcycles on the main road, which also emit smoke, so unless it is directly next to the exhaust outlet, otherwise, the smell is not as good as in the small ones. The shops in the alley are heavy. ?In the small alleys, the shops are very close together, and there is not enough space and air flow in the small alleys to alleviate the smell of oily smoke. Some choose to exhaust the smoke in the rear fire lane, but some of the exhaust pipes are old and obviously broken, and the oily fume is directly connected to the large trash can, and the large trash can is not sealed, so such a Smoke exhaust facilities are basically useless. There is a convenience store that discharges the cooking fume to the sewer, but the joint between the pipeline and the sewer is not completely sealed, and the smell spreads directly to the side. For example, the breakfast shop uses a small fan directly to exhaust the fried breakfast outside, and the smell of breakfast can be smelled from a distance. The main problem and its seriousness According to statistics, lung cancer has become the top cancer in Taiwan.

??藉由親身觀察及里民訪問，歸納了兩個地點為全安里居民最常聚集的公共空間，一個是全安公園，另一則是里民活動中心。全安公園是附近居民散步運動的好地點，從清晨開始就可見到不少居民正在晨間運動，而傍晚的公園更是居民聚集聯絡感情的地方；至於里民活動中心，不僅有里內才藝班在此進行，更是施打疫苗等執行公共衛生政策的所在地，此兩處在全安里內的重要性不在話下。? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
??在踏查的過程中，我們所接觸的居民幾乎都是高齡人口，其中不乏拄著拐杖、坐著輪椅、需要外籍移工照料的長者。經由在大安區戶政事務所及內政部查詢的資料，全安里65歲以上人口比例為21.3%，高於大安區平均18.5%，更遠高於台北市平均15.55%，五分之一以上的人口是老年人，可見高齡化問題在這個社區較台北市其他區域來的更值得重視。而這些高齡人口中又有多少比例如同我們看到行動不便的狀況呢?這個數據我們無從得知，詢問過里長也只得到「前來施打流感疫苗的民眾中有3-5個是坐輪椅的」，因此我們以上述發現居民最常出現的公共空間之一-全安公園，做一次定點性的流量觀察，短短45分鐘內，在公園就出現四位坐輪椅的長者(經過詢問也都是全安里的里民)，數量已和里長所言一整天願意前來施打疫苗的輪椅者差不多，由此可以推斷在全安里的高齡人口中，行動不便的長者確實存在不少。
??上述顯示了這是一個高齡化程度嚴重，且有為數不少行動不便者的社區。然而，回頭檢視在第一段提到兩個里內的公共空間(全安公園及里民活動中心)，這是一個適合高齡人口及行動不便者的場所嗎?有了這個疑問，我們便開始進行以下檢視
?
全安公園：雖然公園入口已有斜坡道可供輪椅進入，但仍發現有以下不足處
斜坡道缺乏扶手，不利拐杖者及輪椅者進入 斜坡道缺乏止滑磚，增加進入時跌倒滑倒的風險 公園內缺乏廁所(無障礙廁所)，不利前來運動的長者緩解老年人頻尿的問題 公園內健身設施多半需以站立姿，輪椅者無法使用 公園內已有部分為具扶手的座椅以利長者起身，但仍有部分不為這樣的友善設計
?
里民活動中心：進入時具有門檻，輪椅者進出不易
?
??由以上的檢視可以看到全安公園及里民活動中心，對於長者及行動不便者來說，都還有不少改善的空間，因此促成了我們構想這個提案-「讓愛無礙-全安里銀髮無障礙社區友善計畫」。",106年12月11日,社會福利,檢核不通過,提案緣起及背景說明不明確，且未擬具體之說明及選項方案,提案內容複雜涉及全安里內公園、里民活動中心等多項改善計畫，屬場域改善建議，不易凝聚選項，i-Voting是一項網路投票機制，需有明確提案內容及選項方案，故建議重新討論選項後再行提案。,0,涉及全安里內公園、里民活動中心等多項改善計畫，屬場域改善建議，不易凝聚選項,, let love go - Quan'anli Silver-haired Barrier-free Community Friendship Project," ???Based on personal observations and interviews with residents, two places are summarized as the public spaces where residents of Quan'anli gather most often. One is Quan'an Park and the other is the Limin Activity Center. Quan'an Park is a good place for nearby residents to take a walk and exercise. From the early morning, many residents can be seen exercising in the morning, and the park in the evening is a place for residents to gather and connect with each other. Classes are held here, and it is also the place where public health policies such as vaccinations are administered. The importance of these two places in Quananli is self-evident. ?????????????????? During the investigation, almost all the residents we contacted were elderly people, many of whom were on crutches, sitting in wheelchairs and needed the care of foreign migrant workers. According to the information inquired at the Da'an District Household Registration Office and the Ministry of the Interior, Quananli 65 The proportion of the population over the age of 21.3% , higher than the average of Daan District 18.5% , much higher than the average of Taipei City 15.55% more than one-fifth of the population is elderly, which shows that the problem of aging in this community is more worthy of attention than in other areas of Taipei City. And how many proportions of these elderly people have mobility issues like we see? ? We have no way of knowing this data. We asked the head of the village and only got ""Among the people who came to get the flu vaccine 3-5 One is in a wheelchair”, so we found that one of the most frequented public spaces for residents - Quan'an Park, do a fixed-point traffic observation, just a short 45 Within minutes, four elderly people in wheelchairs appeared in the park ( After questioning, they are all people from Quan'anli. ) , the number is almost the same as the number of wheelchair users who are willing to come to vaccinate all day long as the village chief said. From this, it can be inferred that among the elderly population in Quan'an Village, there are indeed many elderly people with limited mobility. ?? The above shows that this is a community with a serious aging population and a large number of people with disabilities. However, looking back at the public space mentioned in the first paragraph of the two mile (Quan'an Park and Limin Activity Center ) , is this a venue for the elderly and those with reduced mobility ? With this question in mind, we began to conduct the following inspections ? Safe Park: Although there are ramps at the entrance of the park for wheelchairs to enter, the following shortcomings are still found: the ramps lack handrails, which are not conducive to people with crutches and wheelchairs. The ramps lack non-slip bricks, which increases the risk of falling and slipping when entering Lack of toilets in the park ( accessible toilet ) It is not conducive to the elderly who come to exercise to alleviate the problem of frequent urination of the elderly. Most of the fitness facilities in the park need to be in a standing position. Wheelchair users cannot use some seats in the park. There are already some seats with armrests to facilitate the elderly to get up, but there are still some not designed for such kindness ? Limin Activity Center: There is a threshold when entering, and it is not easy for wheelchair users to enter and exit ??? From the above review, we can see that there is still a lot of room for improvement in Quanan Park and Limin Activity Center for the elderly and people with disabilities, which led us to conceive this proposal -""Let love be free - Quan'anli Silver-haired Barrier-free Community Friendship Project"".", 106 Year 12 moon 11 day, Social Welfare, Check failed," The origin and background description of the proposal is not clear, and no specific description and options have been proposed"," The content of the proposal is complicated and involves multiple improvement plans such as Quan'an Inner Park and Limin Activity Center.

二、發想概念緣由 ? ? ? ?在台北市政府「單車騎乘新文化」的文宣中可知，目前自行車騎乘道路的形式有三： ? ? ? ?(1)人車分道：自行車應騎乘於自行車道。 ? ? ? ?(2)人車共道：自行車與行人共用道路，並應禮讓行人、在禁行時段牽車。? ? ? ? ? ? ?(3)一般道路：靠馬路右側邊行駛。 ? ? ? ?由於我們觀察的道路尚未劃設自行車道，因此根據道路交通安全規則第124條，自行車應靠右側路邊行駛，也就是上述最後一種方式。上述三點的排序並非毫無意義，事實上它反映了自行車騎乘的相對安全性與友善度。而在日常生活的道路使用經驗可發現，大部分的自行車騎士其實多未配戴安全帽（目前法律也僅規範電動自行車騎士應戴安全帽），因此騎乘於路邊具有一定程度的安全疑慮。 ? ? ? ?此外，透過本提案我們也希望在全安里改善自行車於道路使用上普遍存在的尷尬處境。即便在規範之指定道路上行駛，自行車騎士仍常遇到像是行人眾多無法順利通行或是道路汽機車流量大而備感壓力和危險等情況。因此，我們認為若能劃設專屬的自行車道，將能提供更友善的自行車使用空間，提升民眾騎乘自行車的意願與社區之生活品質，同時也讓行人的步行環境更為安心與安全，減少人車共道的不便與意外之發生。",106年12月11日,交通運輸,附議不通過,附議不通過(未達3000則),,8,附議不通過(未達3000則),, Keep your feet on the road and drive on the road," 1. Proposal Background ? ? ? ?This proposal mainly intends to designate bicycle lanes on the border roads of Quan'anli to improve the inconvenience caused by pedestrians and vehicles, and to provide a friendly pedestrian and bicycle lane system. This idea originally originated from the design of the school curriculum. It is hoped that through fieldwork, we can enter a field, that is, Quan'anli, in a more systematic and logical way, and finally put forward the relevant participatory budget concept. After the initial field investigation, we observed that the main roads defining the scope of Quan'anli (including: the third section of Heping East Road, the second section of Anhe Road, Leli Road, and the second section of Dunhua South Road), except that no bicycle lanes were designated, some The sidewalks are also narrow and narrow, causing cyclists to choose to ride on the side of the road in a more dangerous way or have to walk with pedestrians in the limited sidewalk space, causing inconvenience to both parties. After setting the questions, we conducted a traffic survey on the spot. It was found that, based on the data provided by past literature, compared with the section with established bicycle lanes, the flow rate of the observed section was similar or even somewhat higher. 2. The reason for the concept ? ? ? ?According to the ""New Culture of Bicycle Riding"" published by the Taipei City Government, there are currently three forms of bicycle riding roads: ? ? ? ?(1) Separate lanes for pedestrians and vehicles: Bicycles should ride in bicycle lanes. ? ? ? ?(2) Pedestrians and vehicles share the same road: bicycles and pedestrians share the road, and should give way to pedestrians and lead vehicles during prohibited periods. ? ? ? ? ? (3) General roads: drive on the right side of the road. ? ? ? ? Since the road we observed has not yet designated a bicycle lane, according to the road traffic safety rules No. 124 Article, bicycles should drive on the right side of the road, which is the last way mentioned above. The ranking of the above three points is not meaningless, in fact it reflects the relative safety and friendliness of bicycle riding. In the daily road use experience, it can be found that most of the cyclists do not wear helmets (the current law only stipulates that electric bicycle riders should wear helmets), so riding on the roadside has a certain degree of safety concerns . ? ? ? ?In addition, through this proposal, we also hope to improve the common embarrassing situation of bicycles on the road in Quananli. Even when driving on the specified roads, cyclists often encounter situations such as too many pedestrians who cannot pass smoothly, or the traffic of cars and motorcycles on the road is heavy, and they feel pressure and danger. Therefore, we believe that if we can designate exclusive bicycle lanes, it will provide a more friendly space for bicycle use, improve the willingness of the public to ride bicycles and the quality of life in the community, and at the same time make the walking environment for pedestrians more secure and safe, reducing The inconvenience of people and vehicles sharing the same road and the occurrence of accidents.", 106 Year 12 moon 11 day, Transportation, Seconded not passed, Seconded not passed ( not reached 3000 but ),,8, Seconded not passed ( not reached 3000 but ),,,,,,,,

依據憲法人民福利提案政府發七十歲以上老人享有免費壽險及住院及安養等保險由政府擔保且出資十五年如說明
一，由於六十五歲以上已無工作容易生病，因此政府應該公開招標，讓人民及政府省錢又獲利三方作法就是提撥部份保險錢去幫老人投保民間保險二十年後(受益者是政府)政府在得保險費後，第一批加保期滿後取得保費，納投入第二十幾批滿七十歲以上為一輪這樣節省勞建保支出及提供老人多福利多獲利及政府省支出，(假設第一批年滿七十歲總人數總支出為一億，二十年後總支出為三十億含中途有第二十批滿七十歲，結果第二十一年要領回換保第二十一批滿七十歲作為第一次循環老人保險)即政府只要花一次老人保險以後就只用來循環用，獲利政府及當事人住院醫療及給付等，且有多方面好處幫政府省勞建保支出及減輕家屬負擔與政府得獲利人民的醫療及良好照顧。
壞處是政府要先投資七十歲以上人民二十年永久循環費用。往生後取回受益金。其實這是百分之99人民都用的到。建保不是一直虧損拿建保來幫老人投保民間保險是省下健保及勞保費，醫療期間獲利是由人民應得例如住院一天可得三千，住院醫療全部支付.......意外往生受益者政府，其招標內容應載明。

一、自古以來，性交易就一直存在，無法滅絕。臺灣民國60幾年，因美國媒體
??? 的報導，將北投廢娼。多年以來，採用「寓禁於徵」的政策，試圖禁娼禁嫖。
??? 民國80幾年，台北市亦廢除公娼，性交易在臺北市完全非法，結果只是造
??? 成私娼到處流竄。有法官認為罰娼不罰嫖，違反憲法第7條平等原則，申請
??? 大法官會議解釋。2009年大法官會議做出666號解釋，認定罰娼不罰嫖，
??? 違反憲法第7條平等原則，2年後該法條失效。行政院因此被迫做民意調查
??? 及召開公民會議討論，最後將社會秩序維護法送立院修改，依平等原則將
??? 非性專區內之性交易改為娼嫖皆罰，專區內的性交易不罰。因為當時的行政
??? 院長吳敦義個人無娼無嫖世界的理想，才修改成現在的規定。如今地方政府
??? 無一設立性專區，造成事實上娼嫖皆罰的結果，性工作者面臨警察取締的恐
??? 懼及性消費者陷入性匱乏
?二、為解決性需求者無法都透過戀愛或結婚，解決性問題。性工作者無法安心
???? 地從事性交易，以解決其從娼的原因。所以有必要成立性專區，讓雙方解
???? 決他們的問題
?三、有性專區可讓有性需求者解決性需要，提高其生活滿足感，減少其性匱乏
???? 的怨恨。減少對其他無辜的性暴力犯罪。費用通常較便宜，減少其支出。
???? 去除違法汙名。不必被要求確認不是警察或線民，而被要求操作提款機或
???? 購買遊戲點數，避免被騙取財物。保護隱私，不必被要求檢查身分證及工
???? 作證
?四、可讓性工作者滿足其需求，改善其經濟狀況，解決其問題。減少被抽成，
???? 增加其報酬。從事性交易比從事其他犯罪賺錢好。不必過濾警察或線民，
???? 不必擔心警察會突然來臨檢取締。被白嫖或其他侵犯時可報警。去除違法
???? 汙名
?五、減少掛羊頭賣狗肉的性交易場所，讓民眾不至誤入色情場所
?六、如果只設立一個性專區，等於是把所有性交易場所集中，範圍勢必很大。??????
??? 鄰近的民眾數量更多，所遭遇的反對勢必更大。所以分散在特定區域的賓旅
??? 館是上策
?七、需要性交易的市民，必然分散於各行政區，賓旅館也分散於各行政區。此
??? 法方便民眾就近性交易，不必大老遠跑到遙遠的集中型性專區解決性需求，
??? 節省時間及體力，避免交通堵塞及空氣汙染(開汽車及騎機車)及車禍，過程
??? 較為省事
?八、性工作者方便上班，不必大老遠通勤省時省力避塞車減汙染。或許賓旅館
???? 業者提供住宿，或直接住在賓旅館(或可節省住宿費)，或在賓旅館上班，不
???? 必到處奔波應召，避免車禍，減少客人等待
?九、合法後易徵稅，再學習公益彩券，用部分盈餘捐助社會福利，救濟社會貧
???? 苦者
?十、減少警察取締非法性交易的工作，減少警察索賄及黑道索取保護費

規劃公共吸菸區，能減少吸煙者隨時抽菸的習慣，以達到降低吸煙者抽菸頻率及減少路邊煙蒂的產生，也能降低煙蒂造成水溝堵社問題，提升城市容貌。
日本禁菸規範相當嚴格。由於日本政府擔心吸菸者走在路上抽菸時，手垂下來的位置，可能會燙傷到路過的小朋友的臉或身體，嚴禁邊走邊抽。此外，日本街道戶外也是全面禁菸，只有規劃的吸菸區才能讓人解解菸癮。例如，日本新幹線和在來線除部分列車以外，全面禁菸，但新幹線每隔幾個車廂就設有吸菸室，部分車站月台設有吸菸區，車站外大門旁也有規劃吸菸範圍；一般公園則根據禁菸範圍依照比例原則設置多處吸菸區！

我認為，國高中時期不少人都會談戀愛，而這個現象到了自由選課、上課的大學時期開始產生了一些變化。在台灣，大學生比起中學生是更被允許談戀愛的，然而，其實很多沒有戀愛經驗的人，上了風氣自由的大學（就是實質上比較不需要天天跟同學相處）之後反而變得不知道怎麼辦，而成了孤單一人。
至於大學畢業後，這個現象似乎有過之而無不及。很多人的交友管道封閉，可能是從職場，可能是自己必須找個活動或圈子主動參加，這些做法其實都是私人性質的，這讓交友變得好像只是「你家的事」，已不再像學生時期，有一段官式的、必須和同學相處的時光。
我建議政府可以研議從這個想法出發的方案，成立定期（或持續性的）相關地點、組織，要在實質上讓國民有許多「認識異性」的機會（對同性戀來說，則是認識同性），最好可以做到像家醫制度那樣的方便。此政策也許也能刺激生育率，讓原本足不出戶也不知如何出戶的民眾，也能享有美妙的戀愛時光。",107年05月17日,其他,檢核不通過,非純屬本府職權事務,本案所提建議內容（成立官式的交友管道），經本府教育局、民政局檢視，因交友方式、對象涉及個人隱私及自由，應尊重個人自主意願，本市各區已設立社區大學，各大專院校亦有在職進修課程供選擇，提供市民終身教育環境，並同時擴張人際關係，茲因提案內容涉及個人意願及已提供學習環境，因此不進入附議。,0,因提案內容涉及個人意願及已提供學習環境，因此不進入附議。,," Establish an official friendship channel, so that many people who have left the national education can get a guaranteed chance to fall in love"," *This policy may be proposed for those who are more passive in making friends, and this issue may have surpassed the responsibility of the Beijing Municipal Government; and I also deeply feel that the current fertility rate and the state of friendship between men and women in Taiwan, the government is actually responsible.

226,Regulation of Sex Trade and Prevention of STIs in Taiwan,227,2018-05-30,於林森北路設合法性專區 稅收幫助街友等弱勢團體,"一、改變台灣，從首都開始：
社會秩序維護法於2011年修法後，其中90-1條明訂：「直轄市、縣（市）政府得因地制宜，制定自治條例，規劃得從事性交易之區域及其管理」。時隔七年，卻無地方政府政府正視此立法，使得原本性專區內「娼嫖不罰」的立法，因為全國無性專區之設立，變成「娼嫖皆罰」，有違台灣先進國家之進步價值立法意旨。台北身為首善之都，應率先設立合法性專區，以為全國之楷模。
?
二、多數民意力挺性專區，成立已刻不容緩
台北市長柯文哲指示秘書長張哲揚研擬性專區成立之配套措施，並於五月十日誇局處會議中，決定以i-Voting之方式匯集民意，但至今卻未見「政府提案」之相關i-Voting。然而，Yahoo民調「在台灣設立合法性專區，請問您認同嗎？」、「北市議員童仲彥要求北市府推動合法性專區，北市府正評估可行性。根據社會秩序維護法修正案，允許直轄市、縣市政府規劃設置性交易專區，但須與學校、幼兒園、教會等保持距離。」於5月11日至14日所進行之網路民調，於短短四天內，踴入七千人作答，「在台灣設立合法性專區，請問您認同嗎？」有60.8%非常認同、21.4%還算認同，換言之，有82.2%認同設立合法性專區，成立工作已刻不容緩。
?
三、於林森北路設立性專區，建全現有產業鏈及階級金字塔
社會秩序維護法第91-1條明訂，地方政府針對合法性專區之自治條例，應包含下列各款規定：
該區域於都市計畫地區，限於商業區範圍內。 該區域於非都市土地，限於以供遊憩為主之遊憩用地範圍內。但不包括兒童或青少年遊憩場。 前二款之區域，應與學校、幼兒園、寺廟、教會（堂）等建築物保持適當之距離。 台北市傳統性產業聚落，以萬華龍山寺週邊及林森北路一帶最為發達，但基於社維法「應與寺廟保持距離」之限制，龍山寺週邊不可做為合法性專區。林森北路及條通文化區皆屬於商業區，為台北市最適合規劃為合法性專區之地點。
現有之林森北路性產業，多屬於性產業階級金字塔之中、高階酒店或俱樂部，萬華地區之私娼或茶室之弱勢性工作者，應安置到此處，建全各階級人士之性需求及供給鏈，以利市府輔導管理。
?
四、落實性交易場所之安全及性工作者健康檢查
依據社會秩序維護法第91-1條，第四、五、六款，性交易場所應領有執照，曾犯兒童及少年性交易防制及性剝削條例，或人口販運防制法判決有罪者，不得擔任負責人，原領有執照者觸犯以上罪行，撤銷或廢止其執照。
第七、八、九款明訂，性交易服務者應登記、申請證照，並定期接受健康檢查，違反者撤銷其證照，有人類免疫缺乏病毒傳染等相關疾病者，治療痊癒後發還證照。
?
五、稅收提撥一定比例，幫助遊民等弱勢團體
綜觀設立合法性專區之國家，性產業稅收都極為龐大。為落實照顧弱勢之精神，遷移萬華娼妓同時，街友問題，應一併處理，性專區之稅收優先提撥一定比例，專款安置街友等弱勢團體。",107年05月30日,法令與權益、工商財經與產業,附議通過，權責機關已回應,,,2136,,, Set up a legal area on Linsen North Road to help homeless and other disadvantaged groups," 1.

234,Taiwan Smoking Ban Proposal,235,2018-06-04,臺北市應廣設吸菸區及菸蒂回收桶並加強勸導,"【提案緣起】
為了減少臺灣各地菸蒂遍布的現象，我們想先以臺北市作為示範城市，提出「臺北市應廣設吸菸區及菸蒂回收桶並加強勸導」的提案，以下會詳細說明整個提案的過程，希望能得到大眾的響應，同我們一起改善公共空間煙蒂遍佈的亂象。
?
【提案流程】
蒐集吸菸之相關法源資料。 擬定問卷、回收並統整民意資料。 取得多數民意並提出可行之方案。
?
【法源依據】
本提案先行查閱菸害防制法第15條所規範之某些場所全面禁止吸菸，例如：學校、醫療機構、政府機關、公營事業機構、大眾運輸工具、電梯廂內、商場以及三人以上共用之室內工作場所等。第16條針對吸菸區的規範如下：設置吸菸區的場所，應於所有入口處及其他適當地點，設置明顯禁菸標示或除吸菸區外不得吸菸意旨之標示；且除吸菸區外，不得供應與吸菸有關之器物。第一項吸菸區之設置，應符合下列規定： 一、吸菸區應有明顯之標示。 二、吸菸區之面積不得大於該場所室外面積二分之一，且不得設於必經之處。
主要問題癥結點在於：政府並沒有明確規範公共場所的吸菸區設置規範，僅限制吸菸區的場地空間，這對推行吸菸區較無著力點，且並無方法改善公共空間菸蒂遍布的負面風景。
?
【問卷設計、發放】
雖有法律規範，但公共空間菸蒂遍布的約束作用仍有限。因此本提案自行設計問卷、發放問卷，共回收244名各年齡層的臺灣名眾提出問卷的調查，以了解台灣民眾對於菸蒂遍布、二手煙瀰漫以及設置吸菸桶、菸灰缸以及吸菸室的看法。依據自製問卷內容，受訪者244人當中，近九成受訪者表示平時在路上有看到菸蒂遍布於地上之情形，並對此表示這樣對環境美觀有所妨礙。而有將近八成的民眾是支持政府在公共場合增設吸菸室的，並覺得會對煙蒂遍佈跟減少吸到二手煙有所改善。問卷分別有15-35歲及35歲以上的民眾填寫，且各年齡層支持增設吸菸室的比例都達到八成，由此可知民眾大部分皆支持增設吸菸室。雖然有聽說菸蒂可以丟在水溝旁邊，但經過證實此舉不但汙染了水質、造成環境汙染，也會造成清潔人員的負擔。為了改善這種狀況，建議政府檯面上可以加強取締菸蒂、修正有關亂丟菸蒂的法條(如：廢棄物清理法、菸害防制法、環境保護法等)以加強約束吸菸人士，再來可以推動講座宣導，如何減少菸蒂遍布的現象.如何能讓自己不被過多的二手菸所傷等等。基於全台灣僅有40幾間的合法吸菸室來說，是少之又少，但是若要做到實質的效果，建議於便利商店或是一般店家、住家外及任何。公共場合都可以設置吸菸桶或是垃圾桶集中回收，另外可以在一些戶外場所設置吸菸室(如：植物園、遊樂區、公司、展區之類的)，也可以每200或300公尺為基準建立一個菸蒂回收區。只是吸菸室建造所耗資金過於龐大且易壞，所以不易建造，不過若是全民可以一起重視這個議題並設置回收桶以減少菸蒂亂丟的景象的話，相信大家住家附近都能整潔許多！",107年06月04日,環保生態,檢核不通過,非純屬本府職權事務,本案所提建議內容(臺北市應廣設吸菸區及菸蒂回收桶並加強勸導)，經本府衛生局、環保局檢視，因涉及吸菸區設置(菸害防制法規範)，屬中央權管業務，且本市設有2002處行人專用清潔箱，除公車站及禁菸區外皆已掛設熄菸盒供民眾丟棄菸蒂使用，並於今(107)年起輔導販菸商家自主設置熄菸筒設施及周邊環境清潔維護，相關建議已納入政策執行，且部分內容涉及中央權管業務，故擬不開放附議。,0,非純屬本府職權事務,, Taipei City should set up smoking areas and cigarette butt recycling bins and strengthen persuasion,"[The origin of the proposal] In order to reduce the phenomenon of cigarette butts all over Taiwan, we would like to take Taipei City as a model city first, and put forward the proposal that ""Taipei City should widely establish smoking areas and cigarette butt recycling bins and strengthen persuasion"". The whole proposal will be explained in detail below Through the process, we hope to get the response of the public, and work with us to improve the chaos of cigarette butts in public spaces. ? 【Proposal process】 Collect legal sources related to smoking. Draft questionnaires, collect and organize public opinion data. Obtain the majority of public opinion and propose feasible solutions. ? [Legal source basis] This proposal first consults Article 1 of the Tobacco Hazard Prevention Law 15 Smoking is completely prohibited in some places regulated by the article, such as: schools, medical institutions, government agencies, public institutions, public transportation, elevator compartments, shopping malls, and indoor workplaces shared by more than three people. No. 16The regulations for smoking areas are as follows: places where smoking areas are set up should set up obvious no-smoking signs or signs indicating no smoking except in smoking areas at all entrances and other appropriate places; and in addition to smoking areas, no smoking-related utensils. The setting of the smoking area in Paragraph 1 shall meet the following requirements: 1. The smoking area shall be clearly marked. 2. The area of the smoking area shall not be larger than half of the outdoor area of the place, and shall not be located in places that must be passed. The main crux of the problem lies in the fact that the government has not clearly regulated the setting of smoking areas in public places. It only restricts the space of smoking areas. This has little effect on the promotion of smoking areas, and there is no way to improve the negative scenery of cigarette butts in public spaces. ? [Questionnaire design and distribution] Although there are laws and regulations, the restrictive effect of cigarette butts in public spaces is still limited. Therefore, this proposal designs and distributes questionnaires by itself, and a total of 244Taiwanese celebrities of all ages submitted a questionnaire survey to understand Taiwanese people's views on cigarette butts, second-hand smoke, and setting up smoking barrels, ashtrays, and smoking rooms. According to the content of the self-made questionnaire, the respondents 244 Among the people, nearly 90% of the interviewees said that they have seen cigarette butts all over the ground on the road, and they said that this would hinder the beauty of the environment. Nearly 80% of the people support the government to add smoking rooms in public places, and feel that it will improve the spread of cigarette butts and the reduction of second-hand smoke. Questionnaires are 15-35 aged and 35 People over the age of 10 years and over filled it out, and the proportion of all age groups supporting the addition of smoking rooms reached 80%. It can be seen that most of the people support the addition of smoking rooms. Although it has been heard that cigarette butts can be thrown by the ditch, it has been proven that this not only pollutes the water quality, causes environmental pollution, but also causes a burden on the cleaning staff. In order to improve this situation, it is suggested that the government can strengthen the ban on cigarette butts and amend the law on littering cigarette butts (Such as: Waste Cleanup Act, Smoke Hazard Prevention Act, Environmental Protection Act, etc. ) In order to strengthen the restraint of smokers, and then promote lectures and publicity, how to reduce the phenomenon of cigarette butts all over the place . How to keep yourself from being hurt by too much second-hand smoke and so on. Based on the only 40 There are very few legal smoking rooms, but if you want to achieve a substantial effect, it is recommended to use them in convenience stores or general stores, outside your home and anywhere. Smoking buckets or garbage cans can be set up in public places for centralized recycling, and smoking rooms can be set up in some outdoor places ( Such as: botanical gardens, recreational areas, companies, exhibition areas, etc. ) , or every 200 or 300 Establish a cigarette butt recycling area based on the meter. It’s just that the construction of smoking rooms is too expensive and fragile, so it’s not easy to build. However, if the whole people can pay attention to this issue and set up recycling bins to reduce the littering of cigarette butts, I believe everyone’s neighborhood will be much cleaner!", 107 Year 06 moon 04 day, Environmental protection and ecology, Check failed, It is not purely a matter of the government's authority,"Suggestions in this case ( Taipei City should set up smoking areas and cigarette butt recycling bins and strengthen persuasion ) , inspected by the Health Bureau and the Environmental Protection Bureau of the prefecture, because it involves the setting of smoking areas ( Tobacco Hazard Control Act Specification ) , which belongs to the central power management business, and this city has 2002 Cleaning boxes for pedestrians, except for bus stops and no-smoking areas, have installed cigarette extinguishing boxes for people to discard cigarette butts, and today (107) Starting from 2019, we will guide cigarette sellers to independently set up chimney extinguishing facilities and clean and maintain the surrounding environment.

240,Public Housing and Child Care Subsidies,241,2018-06-25,應降低公共住宅的申請標準,"【提案動機】
公共住宅是指政府直接興建、補助興建或民間擁有之適合居住房屋，採「只租不賣」模式，以低於市場租金或免費出租給所得較低的家戶或特殊的弱勢對象的住宅。
現在因為經濟不景氣、房價高漲，很多人連生活都很困難，更何況是買房子。從99年到104年的台灣房價指數(註)，從一開始99年的100到了103年的297一路節節上升，到了104年稍稍下降，但對很多一般家庭來說，買房子還是一輩子都不可能實現的事情，所以都只能租房子，而當房租他們無法負荷時就只能到處搬家，非常辛苦，因此我們希望讓更多有需要的人民可以有個安定的住所，經濟壓力可以減少，也改善大家的生活環境。
※註：房價指數是指大家熟悉的單價每坪多少萬元的觀念，轉換成多少個點數，就有如股票市場上個別公司的股價是多少錢，但還編製了個別產業的股價指數及台灣股價加權指數（總指數）。
?
【發展現況與困境】
目前台北市捷運局提供的4處基地分別位於龍山寺站、港墘站、台北橋站及小碧潭站，總計570戶。除前兩站因戶數少已全數出租外，台北橋及小碧潭站分別有82、53戶空租近2年，北市都發局回應：「主要還是租金太貴，民眾接受度比較低。」可見政府已經知道有租金過高問題，更應盡速解決。
依據目前的現行法令規定，台北市社會住宅辦法第四條提到申請公共住宅的條件為： 1. 年滿二十歲之國民。 2. 在臺北市（以下簡稱本市）設有戶籍，或在本市就學、就業有居住需求者。 3. 本人、配偶、戶籍內之直系親屬及其配偶，均無自有住宅者。 4. 本人、配偶、戶籍內之直系親屬及其配偶，無承租本市國民住宅、公營住宅或社會住宅。 5. 家庭年收入低於公告受理申請當年度本市50%分位點家庭之平均所得，且所得總額平均分配全家人口，平均每人每月不超過本市最低生活費標準之3.5倍者。
根據104年的台北市人民生活品質資料統計，在台北市最低生活支出為27,216元，如果想要買一棟基本的20坪房子，需要5,700萬元，如果都把剩餘的錢存起來，至少需要158年，所以租房子當然是較好的選擇，但是20坪的房子一個月也要33,320元，這樣一個月加起來也要60,536元，因此以申請標準月收入56,550元而言是相當辛苦的。

個人覺得可以參考高速公路的方式，於尖峰時間(07~10，17~21)，開放大型重型機車得行駛路肩。
市民大道高架道路與環東大道為一般道路，以法院判例，當車輛擁塞靜止不動時，大型重型機車是可以車道分割而沒有違規。但與其如此增加汽機車的擦撞風險，不如比照高速公路行之有年的紓解方式，尖峰時段開放大型重型機車行駛市民大道高架道路與環東大道的路肩。
因市民大道高架道路與環東大道路肩略窄，汽車無法行駛，但大型重型機車卻可以有效利用，如此既可讓汽車少塞好幾百台大型重型機車的車距，有效利用道路空間，又能快速紓解兩大高架段的機車數量，相信是所有用路人所樂見的措施。
利益與影響
四輪以上汽車可以減少數幾百台大型重型機車的車距，且四輪以上用路人可以減少未注意而應注意體積較小的大型重型機車所產生的交通風險，從而提升用路人安全。 大型重型機車可以快速離開並略為紓解市民大道高架道路與環東大道塞車狀況，且完全消除車道分割時所產生的擦撞風險。 提高「一人汽車」轉騎乘機車通勤的意願，進而減少市民大道高架道路與環東大道的汽車數量
若有救護車等車輛需利用路肩快速通行： 機車讓道的效率遠高於汽車，如果高速公路施行多年都沒有問題，那市民大道高架道路與環東大道的開放更不會有問題。機車讓道的效率遠高於汽車，如果高速公路施行多年都沒有問題，那市民大道高架道路與環東大道的開放更不會有問題。
若有故障車輛或車禍需移置路肩： 機車併入車道閃避的效率遠高於汽車，如果高速公路施行多年都沒有問題，那市民大道高架道路與環東大道的開放更不會有問題。
以利益來說，開放大型重型機車得行駛路肩對所有市民大道高架道路與環東大道的用路人都有益處，四輪以上用路人減少與大型重型機車的塞車並避免前後碰撞風險，而大型重型機車也能較快速的通過，以紓緩實務上的塞車狀況。
進一步，四輪以上用路人因為大型重型機車在市民大道高架道路與環東大道的便利性，將有意願改以大型重型機車通勤，減少市民大道高架道路與環東大道上的一人汽車數量。
此外，開放大型重型機車得行駛路肩並不影響原四輪以上之用路人之用路。

若開放市民大道高架道路與環東大道之路肩，予大型重型機車通行。可於試行期後，開放其它快速道路於大型重型機車使用。以紓解尖峰時間之塞車狀況。",107年07月31日,交通運輸,檢核不通過,非純屬本府職權事務,有關本案所提建議內容(尖峰時段開放大型重型機車行駛市民大道高架道路與環東大道路肩)，經本府交通局檢視涉及中央權管業務(道路交通管理處罰條例)，因此不進入附議。,0,非純屬本府職權事務,," During peak hours, large heavy locomotives are open to drive on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and the shoulder of Huandong Avenue"," During rush hours, the elevated roads of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue are really congested, but how to relieve the massive traffic flow? Personally, I think you can refer to the way of the expressway, during rush hour (07~10 , 17~21) open large heavy locomotives have to drive on the shoulder. The elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue are ordinary roads. According to the court case, when vehicles are congested and stationary, large and heavy locomotives can split their lanes without violating the rules. But instead of increasing the collision risk of automobiles and motorcycles in this way, it is better to compare the long-established relief method of the expressway, and open large-scale heavy locomotives to drive on the shoulders of the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue during peak hours. Because the elevated road of Civic Avenue and the shoulder of Huandong Avenue are slightly narrow, cars cannot drive, but large and heavy locomotives can be effectively used. This can reduce the gap between hundreds of large and heavy locomotives and effectively use the road space. It can also quickly relieve the number of locomotives on the two elevated sections, which is believed to be a measure that all passers-by are happy to see. Benefits and impacts Vehicles with four or more wheels can reduce the distance between hundreds of large heavy-duty locomotives, and pedestrians with four or more wheels can reduce the traffic risks caused by large, heavy-duty locomotives that have not noticed but should pay attention to smaller volumes, thereby improving pedestrians Safety. Large heavy locomotives can leave quickly and slightly relieve the traffic jams on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue, and completely eliminate the risk of collisions caused by lane splitting. Increase the willingness of ""one-person cars"" to switch to commuting by locomotive, thereby reducing the number of cars on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue. The highway has been in operation for many years without problems, and the opening of the elevated road of Citizen Avenue and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. The efficiency of giving way to locomotives is much higher than that of automobiles. If the expressway has been in operation for many years without any problems, then the opening of the Citizen Avenue elevated road and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. If there is a faulty vehicle or a car accident, the road shoulder needs to be moved: The efficiency of locomotives merging into the lane is much higher than that of cars. If the expressway has been implemented for many years without problems, then the opening of the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. In terms of benefits, the opening of the road shoulders for large and heavy locomotives is beneficial to all passers-by on the Civic Boulevard Elevated Road and Huandong Avenue. Passers-by with four or more wheels can reduce traffic jams with large and heavy locomotives and avoid the risk of front and rear collisions. Locomotives can also pass through faster to alleviate practical traffic jams. Further, passers-by with four or more wheels will be willing to use large heavy-duty locomotives to commute because of the convenience of large heavy-duty motorcycles on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue, so as to reduce the number of one-person cars on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue. In addition, the opening of large and heavy locomotives to drive on the road shoulder does not affect the original use of the road for passers-by with more than four wheels.? If other expressways are open to the shoulders of Civic Avenue Elevated Road and Huandong Avenue, large heavy locomotives will be allowed to pass. After the trial period, other expressways can be opened for use by large and heavy locomotives.

253,Taipei MRT station naming and location,254,2018-08-12,台北捷運各站普遍設置日語、韓語廣播，並且酌情刪除台語、客語廣播,"根據中華民國交通部觀光局網站的資料，2016年度日本旅台人數為189萬5702人，韓國旅台人數為88萬4397人；2017年度日本旅台人數為189萬5854人，韓國旅台人數為105萬4708人。顯見日韓兩國為全球（非漢語區國家）來台旅客人數最多者。其中，韓國旅客人數近兩年來的成長幅度更高達19.26%。對於目標躋身國際城市的台北而言，在大眾交通運輸上為日韓兩國旅客的設計的指標或標語之必要性及迫切性可謂不言而喻。對於來台北觀光的旅客而言，台北捷運是他們一定會使用到的交通工具。台北捷運的便利性、安全性、舒適度、捷運文化也一直是台北市民的驕傲。可惜的是台北捷運的廣播數年來只有「中文、英文、台語、客語」四種語言，在努力成為國際化城市及積極吸引外國旅客發展觀光上不免顯得美中不足。近日台北捷運已有部分區域加上了日語廣播，是為一大突破。有鑒於近年來台韓交流日漸頻繁，韓語廣播的設置也應該積極納入考慮方為上策。
相對地，根據客家委員會最新的「客家民眾客語使用狀況研究」報告，民國102年符合客家基本法定義的客家人中，只有 65.5%能聽懂客語（其中，60歲以上者就佔89.4%)，且以桃竹苗地區為主。在有子?的客家民眾中，與子?交談時使用的語言以國語（即上述中文）占多?，為 68.7%；和子?主要以客語溝通者僅16.6%。台語方面也面臨和客語類似的問題，況且目前絕大多數使用客語或台語者也能夠聽說中文。由此可見，台北捷運廣播中的客語及台語相形之下其存在之必要性不高。
為了讓台北更好，將台北打造一個友善外國旅客的國際城市，並且避免台北捷運廣播過於冗長，在此提案積極地於台北捷運各站普遍設置日語、韓語廣播，並且酌情刪除台語及客語廣播。",107年08月12日,交通運輸,檢核不通過,非純屬本府職權事務,有關本案所提建議內容(臺北捷運各站普遍設置日語、韓語廣播，並且酌情刪除台語、客語廣播)，經捷運公司檢視涉及中央權管法令「大眾運輸工具播音語言平等保障法」第6條規定，除國語外，另應以閩南語、客家語播音。又考量捷運站與站間距離短及廣播時間有限，僅能再增加1種外語廣播。經統計到訪臺北市之境外旅客以日籍佔多數，故業於部分熱門景點車站(如士林站、臺北101/世貿站)增加日語廣播，爰不開放附議。,0,非純屬本府職權事務,," Japanese and Korean broadcasts are generally installed at all stations of the Taipei MRT, and Taiwanese and Hakka broadcasts are deleted as appropriate"," According to the website of the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Republic of China, 2016 The annual number of Japanese travelers to Taiwan is 189 Ten thousand 5702 people, the number of Koreans traveling to Taiwan is 88 Ten thousand 4397 people; 2017 The annual number of Japanese travelers to Taiwan is 189 Ten thousand 5854 people, the number of Koreans traveling to Taiwan is 105Ten thousand 4708 people. It is obvious that Japan and South Korea are the world's (non-Chinese-speaking countries) with the largest number of tourists coming to Taiwan. Among them, the number of tourists from South Korea has grown even more in the past two years. 19.26% For Taipei, which aims to become an international city, the necessity and urgency of designing indicators or slogans for Japanese and Korean tourists in public transportation is self-evident. For tourists who come to Taipei for sightseeing, the Taipei MRT is the means of transportation that they will definitely use. The convenience, safety, comfort, and MRT culture of Taipei MRT have always been the pride of Taipei citizens. It is a pity that the broadcasting of the Taipei MRT has only been in four languages: ""Chinese, English, Taiwanese, and Hakka"" for several years. It is inevitably a fly in the ointment in its efforts to become an international city and actively attract foreign tourists to develop tourism. Recently, some areas of the Taipei MRT have added Japanese broadcasting, which is a major breakthrough. In view of the increasingly frequent exchanges between Taiwan and South Korea in recent years, it is the best policy to actively consider the setting of Korean broadcasting. In contrast, according to the Hakka Committee's latest report ""Research on Hakka Hakka Usage among Hakka People"", the Republic of China 102 Among the Hakkas meeting the definition of the Hakka Basic Law, only 65.5% Can understand Hakka (among them, 60 over the age of 89.4%) and mainly peach and bamboo seedlings. in have child ?

The Taiwanese language also faces similar problems to the Hakka language, and the vast majority of people who use Hakka or Taiwanese can also speak and hear Chinese. It can be seen from this that the Hakka and Taiwanese language used in the broadcasting of the Taipei MRT is not necessary in comparison. In order to make Taipei better, build Taipei into an international city that is friendly to foreign tourists, and avoid the Taipei MRT broadcast being too lengthy, this proposal actively sets up Japanese and Korean broadcasts at all stations of the Taipei MRT, and deletes Taiwanese and other languages as appropriate.

如何執行：設立高空纜車前並加以妥善規劃， 以每年國際觀光客來台的數量不只上台北101 相對也會上象山纜車，門票收入相對可帶來可觀的財政稅收（但是纜車建設要是值得觀光客花錢儀看的設施）。
目前討論情形：要發展觀光財與永續城市建設勢必要有遠觀的規劃，什麼是對這個城市值得投資的建設以及花多少經費可以創造很大的觀光價值，我想這是值得討論的議題。

297,Pedestrian Traffic Safety and Priority Measures,298,2019-03-21,區分開直行車、轉彎車、行人通行，這三者通過馬路的時間，行人過馬路時有自己的專用時間,"現在大部分馬路都是行人跟汽機車一起通行，但有時候汽機車需要轉彎時，常常不會考慮到馬路上是否有行人正在通行，導致有三個情況發生:
因某些道路只有2線道或1線道，所以轉彎車輛在等行人通過時，往往會大排長龍，影響直行和轉彎的車潮；又因為行人的通行時間跟一般汽機車的通行時間相近，轉彎的車輛只能用很少的時間來排解轉彎的車潮，更會導致車輛強闖紅燈，或整體車輛塞在馬路上的情況；另外如果直行的車輛進入到轉彎道時，因為不想等待轉彎的時間強制轉到直行道時，更會引起交通的亂象。 因轉彎車輛不想等待行人通行，所以往往一些沒公德心的車主會找尋行人較少的空缺檔先行轉彎，有些更會狂按喇叭來加速行人通行，這也是很多外國觀光客及本地行人對台灣交通有很大的怨念。 因為行人跟車輛是一起通行的關係，當綠燈時，有很多停靠在人行道機車格內的機車，會順勢通行在行人斑馬線上，增加行人通行的危險。
另外，雖然有很多地點有實施車輛跟行人通行時間分開，如信義區市政府路口附近，但大部分這類的路口都是只有某些時段才會實施，夜晚跟凌晨不會用，大多數20點後就不會實行，但這段時間的行人還是非常的多，有些晚下班的車潮這時間也會出現，所以就會有上訴的三點問題出來。

Pedestrians have their own special time when crossing the road"," Now most of the roads are pedestrians and motor vehicles passing together, but sometimes when motor vehicles need to turn, they often do not consider whether there are pedestrians passing on the road, resulting in three situations : because some roads only 2 lane or 1Therefore, when turning vehicles are waiting for pedestrians to pass, there will often be a long queue, which will affect the flow of straight-going and turning vehicles; Time will be used to resolve the tide of turning traffic, which will lead to vehicles forcibly running red lights, or the overall vehicle jam on the road; in addition, if a straight vehicle enters a turning lane, because it does not want to wait for the turning time to force it to turn to the straight lane, it is even more difficult. It will cause traffic chaos. Because turning vehicles do not want to wait for pedestrians to pass through, some car owners without public morality will look for an open gear with fewer pedestrians and turn first, and some will even honk their horns to speed up pedestrians. There is a lot of resentment. Because pedestrians and vehicles are passing together, when the light is green, many motorcycles parked in the motorcycle grid on the sidewalk will pass along the pedestrian zebra crossing, increasing the danger of pedestrians. In addition, although there are many places where the time separation between vehicles and pedestrians is implemented, such as near the intersection of Xinyi District City Hall, most of these intersections are only implemented at certain times, and they will not be used at night and early morning.20 It will not be implemented after midnight, but there are still a lot of pedestrians during this period, and some traffic rushes after get off work will also appear at this time, so there will be three points of appeal.

Garbage Bag Policies in Taipei City",300,2019-04-11,台北市專用垃圾袋改為生物可分解式垃圾袋,"【提案背景說明】
目前台北市的專用垃圾袋政策，雖已達到鼓勵垃圾減量與回收分類的效果，但若要更進一步帶領市民走向無塑生活，目前聚乙烯(PE材質)的專用垃圾袋，還是有焚燒帶來空氣汙染與在大自然下難以分解的問題。 而臺灣目前已有少數公司開始研發生物可分解式塑膠袋，美國的國際生物分解產品協會(BPI)認證之生物可分解式垃圾袋網站上的垃圾袋售價，依照現在美金匯率大約是每只2.62元(網址：https://reurl.cc/WOaex)，相當於3公升的專用垃圾袋規格(每只售價約1.2元)。 目前看來最大的問題應是成本考量，但若把塑膠燃燒空汙造成公民長期與世代的健康危害的健康成本(健保花費)，加上各種商業合作下可以壓低成本的手段(例如：與國外公司合作與大量購入、臺灣生技公司研發並申請BPI認證)，是否能讓『生物可分解式垃圾袋』變成一種可能?",108年04月11日,環保生態,檢核不通過,行政機關已對提案內容有既定政策規劃，且不適合依提案內容調整,"一、本案經本府環保局回復，本市專用垃圾袋售價係為民眾支付之垃圾清除處理費，非製作成本，另依提案中所提供生物可分解袋售價(每只2.62元)，已較目前本市3公升專用垃圾袋製作成本(每只約0.437元)高出5.9倍之多。
二、本市專用垃圾袋未採用「可分解塑膠」之主要原因，在於目前「可分解塑膠」之成本仍高於聚乙烯等一般塑膠數倍，而可分解塑膠之主要功能在於此類塑膠製品進入垃圾衛生掩埋場掩埋後，可加速分解，減輕因一般垃圾袋包覆造成掩埋場內垃圾長期不易腐化問題，而目前本市垃圾處理係採焚化方式，而非掩埋處理，故如將可分解塑膠袋送入焚化爐焚化，則無前述功能，也不會減少焚化爐之廢氣，且本市於89年7月實施垃圾費隨袋徵收政策以來，專用垃圾袋材質採高密度聚乙烯及線性低密度聚乙烯，為純粹之碳氫化合物，經燃燒後僅產生二氧化碳及水蒸氣，不會產生戴奧辛或其他有害氣體，應不致於污染環境，使用前述塑膠材質專用垃圾袋仍是現階段較可行之選擇。

At present, a few companies in Taiwan have begun to develop biodegradable plastic bags. The price of garbage bags on the website of biodegradable garbage bags certified by the International Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) in the United States is about 1 per bag according to the current US dollar exchange rate. 2.62 yuan (website: https://reurl.cc/WOaex), which is equivalent to a 3-liter special garbage bag size (each price is about 1.2 yuan). At present, it seems that the biggest problem should be cost considerations, but if we consider the health costs (health insurance costs) of long-term and generational health hazards caused by plastic burning and air pollution, plus various means of reducing costs under commercial cooperation (for example: with Foreign companies cooperate and buy in large quantities, Taiwan biotechnology companies develop and apply for BPI certification), can it make ""biodegradable garbage bags"" a possibility?", 108 Year04 moon 11 day, Environmental protection and ecology, Check failed," The administrative agency has established policy plans for the content of the proposal, and it is not suitable to adjust according to the content of the proposal"," 1. This case was responded to by the Environmental Protection Bureau of the local government.

The price of the biodegradable bag provided in the proposal is also ( each 2.62 Yuan ) , compared with the current city 3 Liter special garbage bag production cost ( each about 0.437 Yuan ) higher than 5.9 times as much. 2. The main reason why ""degradable plastics"" are not used in special garbage bags in this city is that the cost of ""degradable plastics"" is still several times higher than ordinary plastics such as polyethylene, and the main function of decomposable plastics lies in such plastic products After being buried in a garbage sanitary landfill, the decomposition can be accelerated, and the problem of long-term non-corrosion of the garbage in the landfill caused by the general garbage bag covering is alleviated. Currently, the garbage disposal in this city adopts incineration instead of landfill, so it can be decomposed Putting the plastic bags into the incinerator for incineration will not have the aforementioned functions and will not reduce the exhaust gas of the incinerator. 89 Year 7Since the implementation of the garbage fee collection policy in July, the special garbage bags are made of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene, which are pure hydrocarbons. After burning, only carbon dioxide and water vapor will be produced, and no dioxin or other harmful substances will be produced. The gas should not pollute the environment. Using the above-mentioned special plastic garbage bags is still a more feasible choice at this stage. 3.

303,Taiwan Smoking Ban Proposal,304,2019-05-07,希望台北市比照新北市，執行連鎖超商、咖啡店騎樓將全面禁菸,"一、新北市衛生局於4月25日宣布，今年9月起新北市的連鎖超商、咖啡店騎樓將執行全面禁菸，目前為宣導期，不過自9月1日起違者、最高將可裁罰1萬元。首波執法對象包括了7-ELEVEN、全家、OK、萊爾富、美廉社、星巴克、85度C、路易莎咖啡8家業者、約2600個營業場所。
二、臺北市的連鎖超商、咖啡店，密度較新北市更高，尤其是學校周邊的店家，更是孩童經常前往消費或出入之場所，如未全面禁菸、所有人都可自由聚集在店家前口抽菸（許多店家現況即是如此），等於變相讓孩童長時間遭受二手菸的迫害，日積月累之下，成為孩童健康一大隱形殺手。
三、實際數據已證實，二手菸對身體傷害極大：(以下資料來源國民健康署網站)
二手菸已被國際癌症研究中心（IARC）歸類為一級致癌物質，全球每年有將近600萬名吸菸者及60萬名非吸菸者死於一手菸及二手菸的危害 臺灣每年約有2萬4,000名死於吸菸，而有3,000名死於二手菸害，每年因二手菸罹病約達15萬至23萬人，平均約2至3分鐘就有1名不吸菸者因他人吸菸而罹患疾病。 如欲進一步了解，https://www.mohw.gov.tw/fp-2737-9062-1.html
四、希望醫生市長柯文哲，可以站出來捍衛市民拒絕被迫吸二手菸的權力。即便騎樓不是法定禁菸場所，但依據《菸害防制法》規定，各級主管機關可以自行公告指定。新北市已經做到，台北市絕對也可以，雙北是共同商活圈，衷心祈求台北市能夠早日儘速跟進此政策。",108年05月07日,醫療食品健康,檢核不通過,已依民眾提案執行或納入要執行者,本提案經本府衛生局回復刻正研議可行之執行方案，提案內容屬機關已依提案內容執行或納入要執行者，因此不開放附議。,0,已依民眾提案執行或納入要執行者,," I hope that Taipei City will implement a complete ban on smoking in chain supermarkets, coffee shops and arcades, as New Taipei City does.","1.

Smokers and 600,000 non-smokers die from the harm of first-hand smoke and second-hand smoke. In Taiwan, about 24,000 people die from smoking every year, and 3,000 die from second-hand smoke.

As a nearby resident, I often jog here, and I have also participated in local road runs. I always feel that the high beach next to the river bank is too empty and overgrown with weeds. After careful investigation, I found exotic plants such as South American Wedelia, big-flowered grass and copper coins. Grasses spread and occupy the river bank, so the idea of planting native trees on the river bank was born. Selecting suitable flowering and ornamental tree species will not only attract birds and butterflies to help the development of the native ecosystem, but also its flowering season can also become a feature of Taipei’s waterfront, driving tourism development. 2.

There are sporadic plantings on the site, and the growth conditions are quite good after investigation, which shows that the environmental conditions must be suitable for its growth. 2. Neem is a classic native tree species, with fast growth, deep roots, and strong wind resistance. Its flowers and fruits can attract birds and butterflies. In spring, the purple flowers blooming all over the trees are quite romantic and have high ornamental value. A large number of blooms can become a tourist attraction. 3. Neem has strong vitality, can adapt to various soils, and is easy to cultivate and manage. 3.

I hope the city government can consider restoring the ecology of river wetlands within the allowable range, not just point-shaped wetlands The park is a stretch of strip-shaped wetland waterfront. The specific method includes planting Taiwan’s rare and native wet plants such as bellows trees, Shuishe willows, and fringed flowers in the near-water area to provide biological habitats, embankment protection, and external restoration.

As a nearby resident, I often jog here, and I have also participated in local road running. Great progress has been made, but its scope is limited to the main part of the park on the left bank, and the selection of species is mostly exotic horticultural species; the part on the right bank has almost no planning, and is full of invasive exotic species such as South American Wedelia, sagegrass and copper money grass wait. ? ? ?

Resilient city: Embankment reinforcement plants retain water and soil ? ? ?The bellows tree, a shrub planted by the ancestors for berm protection since ancient times, was once seen everywhere in Taiwan, but it has almost become extinct in the wild in recent years due to the cementation of its waterfront habitat. Nowadays, the concept of river governance has gradually changed from cement embankment to restoration of natural embankment. Bellows tree is a very good option for native embankment reinforcement plants. On the one hand, it is easy to survive cuttings. On the other hand, it belongs to shrubs. The tree is not large and does not violate water conservancy. Flood control considerations in the ""River Area Planting Regulations"" of the Department of Agriculture will help prevent excessive erosion of river banks from causing downstream siltation. Therefore, it is recommended to the city government that it can be planted on non-cement embankments. It can be used for bank stabilization, ecology and ornamental purposes.

Dance Venues in Taipei",312,2019-06-11,使i-Voting成為提供開放政府 全民參與youtube網紅,"議案背景源起:
?
? 某天在捷運內走路時，看到有參加i-Voting各區提起申請人員擺攤，我好奇走了過去，有位女士向我請求，幫他們投他們轄區所提的方案，對我說只要5分鐘就好，但我告訴他我想看完其他區的在做決定，但由於那個時間點，我趕著上班，所以無法當場看完。
? 後來當我有空時上i-Voting時，發現系統並不好用，常常只找到簡短的文字檔，後來才找到一些稍長的提案內容，但12區都要一一下載，在看完文字檔，實在是太讓人感到煩躁了，讓我很想放棄看完12區的內容。一個好的想法付諸實踐時，要多加考慮使用者的感受，現代人面對訊息爆炸，如果要讓訊息傳播的速度快一點，必須使用現代人常使用的地方來推廣，這樣才能讓好的想法發揮最大的效用。
?
建議:
?
1. 修改i-Voting目前網站規劃
修改i-Voting目前網站規劃，使提案人需繳交影片檔，還需找人專門管理i-Voting的youtube頻道(例如 管理柯文哲市長youtube的人員或有相關經驗的人員)
2. 讓提案人都準備簡單短片
應該讓提案人準備簡短的影片來介紹，才能讓想參於公共事務的人，能簡單快速的了解，然後在影片下方附上詳細的規劃內容連結，讓想知道詳細內容的人也能直接找到，而且現在人手一支手機，要拍成短片，是很簡單就可以達成，也可看出提案人是否用心。
3. 利用youtube使i-Voting成為網紅
現在人幾乎都會上youtube觀看影片，所以若能讓提案人都準備簡短的影片來介紹，那就可使i-Voting如同一個想成為網紅的人一般，利用youtube來打造一個環境，一個好的公眾提案都能讓市民簡單又快速的了解與知道。長久經營下來自然可以吸引人民來定點觀看公眾事務的提案，才能快速又方便的使i-Voting發揮效果，且使用youtube也可讓看過影片的名眾利用分享或複製連結，傳給親朋好友，來達到資訊快速傳播的功能。並且youtube有訂閱功能，能讓關心台北建設的人能即時收到訊息。
4. 利用現有資源宣傳
可利用市府目前已有高人氣的平台如柯文哲市長的fb,line,IG,台北旅遊網,熊讚…等來宣傳，還可讓熊讚以網紅i-Voting的朋友去一些知名youtube家(蔡阿嘎和蔡桃貴、啾啾鞋、閱部客、這群人、阿滴英文…)推薦

?
以上當我住新北投的時候，的確會以當地人的思維去考慮，但離開當地後，區間車延伸到新北投站的方式反而會影響較大的群眾需要付出更多的時間。
?
其實住新北投當時，還有另一個想法，是源於我去日本旅遊時看到的，在大阪阪急梅田站(終點站)，每條單獨鐵軌的左右兩邊皆有月台，列車到站時，會先開一側讓車上的人下車，等一段時間之後，兩邊的門會同時打開，讓月台上的人可以上車，也可以穿越車輛，讓需要去其他月台的人，不需要繞過車頭。
?
回到北投-新北投；因為新北投的車輛是三節車廂，之前在北投站等車時，看著三節車廂進站，又開回去，總是有一大段鐵軌沒有用到，上面長滿鏽斑，每天就是看著鏽斑等車，如果可以在沒有用到的鐵軌上加蓋月台平台，讓北投-大安區間車在北投站停車時，該三節車廂左右兩邊的門都打開，如此是不是可以方便需要往返新北投的民眾，不需要再上下樓梯耗費時間，也不會影響到原本的班次",108年06月20日,交通運輸,檢核不通過,行政機關已對提案內容有既定政策規劃，且不適合依提案內容調整,"本案經臺北大眾捷運股份有限公司回復如下：

Dance Venues in Taipei",317,2019-07-09,應修改《臺北市競選廣告物管理自治條例》，更嚴格限制競選廣告物的使用,"每逢選舉期間，競選看板、海報、布條、旗幟等廣告物氾濫，候選人的照片、口號充斥在各個街道、大樓、甚至觀光景點，嚴重影響城市美觀。
另外，競選廣告物的製作、設置成本高昂，根據《天下雜誌》的報導，台北市的看板設置租金從每月2萬至10萬都有，在人潮最多的地段可以到每月40萬元；中山大學的《臺灣選舉經費制度之研究（以高雄市議會為例）》一文，在訪談高雄市的五名議員後亦得知，他們的選舉經費從500萬到1500萬之間，而文宣費用就佔總費用的50%，亦即光宣傳費用就高達數百萬之鉅。同時，五名受訪議員也一致認同，選舉經費越高的候選人，當選機率就越高。當候選人是以其資力而非問政的品質來競爭，就難以選出最符合市民利益的人選，且財力將成為市民參政權的隱形門檻。
競選經費的高昂，亦會增加選上後受到獻金捐贈者影響的可能，進而有為特定人物關說、安插人事的風險，競選經費上限的規範，雖然不屬於地方政府的權責，但透過限制廣告物的設置，就可以減少競選經費的需求，進而達到減少競選支出的結果，因此，限制選舉廣告的軍備競賽有其必要性。
然而，本市的《臺北市競選廣告物管理自治條例》目前只規範廣告物的長寬尺寸且極為寬鬆。參考國外法規，日本《公職選舉法》規定競選海報只能張貼在公營的海報張貼處，且對大小也有所限制，法國也有類似的規範，韓國《公職選舉與選舉違法防止法》對於每個選舉區能張貼的海報、布幕數量也有所規範，這些國家的作法都能維護城市景觀，並降低競選支出。

In addition, the cost of making and setting up campaign advertisements is high. According to a report by Commonwealth Magazine, the rent for setting up billboards in Taipei City ranges from 2 million to 10 Everything is available, and in the most crowded areas, it can reach monthly 40In the article ""Research on Taiwan's Election Funding System (Taking Kaohsiung City Council as an Example)"" published by Sun Yat-Sen University, after interviewing five councilors in Kaohsiung City, we also learned that their election funds ranged from 500 million to 1500 between 10,000 and 10,000, and the cost of publicity accounted for 50% that is to say, the cost of publicity alone is as high as millions. At the same time, the five interviewed MPs also agreed that candidates with higher election expenses have higher chances of being elected. When candidates compete on the basis of their financial resources rather than political qualities, it will be difficult to select candidates who best serve the interests of the citizens, and financial resources will become an invisible threshold for citizens to participate in political power. The high cost of campaign expenses will also increase the possibility of being influenced by donors after being elected, and there is a risk of speaking for a specific person and placing personnel. Although the regulation of the upper limit of campaign expenses is not the responsibility of the local government, it is through Restricting the setting of advertisements can reduce the demand for campaign funds, thereby achieving the result of reducing campaign expenditures. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the arms race of election advertisements. However, the city's ""Taipei City Autonomous Regulations on the Management of Election Advertisements"" currently only regulates the length and width of advertisements and is extremely loose. Referring to foreign laws and regulations, Japan's ""Public Office Election Law"" stipulates that campaign posters can only be posted in public posters, and there are also restrictions on the size.

不過，考慮到政府經費以及大眾如廁習慣的問題，我並非提倡全面將北捷廁所的馬桶更換為免治馬桶，反之，我則是希望捷運局能先從部分捷運轉乘大站開始進行免治馬桶的更換，並且更換部分亦僅限於現有的坐式馬桶。再者，考量到部分人仍舊不習慣免治馬桶，故坐式馬桶更換為免治馬桶的比例亦應暫時以百分之五十為上限。而之所以要先從轉乘大站開始進行更換，則是因為這些站點的旅客眾多，廁所的使用率也高，如此我們便能藉此增加此項政策的曝光度，隨後再進行相關實際使用意見的調查，來進一步考慮政策是否應該延續下去。

On the contrary, I hope that the MRT Bureau can start with some MRT transit stations. Replacement of the exempt toilet, and the replacement part is also limited to the existing sitting toilet.

325,Pedestrian Traffic Safety and Priority Measures,326,2019-08-22,全面更改道路與行人共行，以減少車輛回堵或造成車禍等狀況。,"構思源起：
鑒於各縣市巔峰交通流量或市區道路壅塞等狀況，時常因行人通行導致交通堵塞、車禍或應注意能注意而未注意之車輛而發生故意過失等死亡重傷事件。
執行及現況：
就現行狀況各路口汽機車直行或左右轉彎，同時左右兩側斑馬線亦開放行人通行，往往造成左右轉車輛排隊等候行人通過，而導致交通壅塞、搶道或占用直行道路等狀況，一來若偶遇三寶行人則有安全疑慮，二來行人倘未注意來車強行通過則易發生憾事，再來多起大型車輛重大事故，除車輛死角外亦為各路口車輛與行人併行所致。
癥結點：
應避免【汽機車應禮讓行人】之誤導標語，誤讓許多汽機車駕駛人或行人有錯誤觀念，走斑馬線最大又或者行人都應該自己知道或注意左右來車等，故應全面實施汽機車與過馬路行人享有分開通行等權利。",108年08月22日,交通運輸,檢核不通過,行政機關已對提案內容有既定政策規劃，且不適合依提案內容調整,"有關本案所提建議內容(將台北捷運廁所之坐式馬桶一半換為免治馬桶)，經交通局(交工處)檢視如下：
一、查本市大部分號誌路口皆採行人行車綠燈同開，於部分人車衝突嚴重路口，本處設有行人專用、行人早開及行人早關時相以減少人車衝突情形，惟本處針對時相實施與否，均需整體評估轉向車流量、路口服務水準、行人通行量、路口幾何條件（路寬、路型）等因素，綜合衡酌人車之正、負面效應下，方決定是否實施，否則貿然實施，將導致行車壅塞及行人抱怨等候時間過長等負面影響，目前已有訂定評估之準則依人車流量實施。
二、另本市截至108年7月已實施行人專用時相214處、行人綠燈早開181處及行人綠燈早關560處路口，以減少人車衝突及增進轉向車疏解，後續持續檢討本市路口設置行人專用時相、行人早開及行人早關時相之可行性，以增進交通安全。

Execution and current status: According to the current situation, automobiles and motorcycles at each intersection go straight or turn left and right. At the same time, the zebra crossings on the left and right sides are also open to pedestrians. This often causes vehicles turning left and right to wait in line for pedestrians to pass, resulting in traffic congestion, lane grabbing, or occupation of straight roads, etc. First, if you encounter pedestrians in Sanbao by chance, you will have safety concerns. Second, if pedestrians do not pay attention to the oncoming vehicles and force to pass, accidents will easily occur. In addition, there are many major accidents with large vehicles. Crucial point: Avoid misleading slogans such as ""Vehicles and motorcycles should give way to pedestrians"", which misleads many motor vehicle drivers or pedestrians to have the wrong idea that the zebra crossing is the biggest, or that pedestrians should know or pay attention to oncoming vehicles, etc., so it should be fully implemented Motor vehicles and pedestrians crossing the road have the right to pass separately.", 108 Year 08 moon twenty two day, Transportation, Check failed," The administrative agency has established policy plans for the content of the proposal, and it is not suitable to adjust according to the content of the proposal","Suggestions on this case ( Replacing half of the seated toilets in Taipei MRT toilets with disposable toilets ) , via the Transportation Bureau ( delivery office ) The inspection is as follows: 1.

326,Traffic Management in Zhongshan North Road,327,2019-09-12,移除中山北路一段至三段的雙向分隔島及路樹,"?
提案原因：本人因常開車及騎車行經中山北路，明顯發現中山北路遠比其他的南北向道路、譬如承德路、松江路、重慶北路、新生北路、環河北路來的更為壅塞，主因為以下幾項
?
1.中山北路有大量公車行經，包括218、220、247、310、287、260、279、277、203、292、221、1717、636、1819等多路公車行駛，
?
2.中山北路亦有多家銀行、公司行號、飯店、市場、學校、餐飲店、零售店等進駐，每日的車流量及人流量相當可觀。
?
3.由於中山北路每日都有大量的車流量，常常會有小客車臨停或違停的情形，亦有大量公車及計程車會停靠乘載客人，此因素導致中山北路的交通情形更為惡化。
?
4.中山北路匯集了許多主要東西向道路、如民族東西路、民權東西路、民生東西路、長安東西路、長春路、南京東西路、市民大道、忠孝東西路等，每日車流匯集量相當大。
?
5.中山北路設有兩條中央分隔島及大量路樹，雖可美化市容，但也造成了交通過於壅塞，綜觀台北市的主要南北向道路，如承德路、松江路、重慶北路、新生北路、環河北路等，中山北路的交通情形皆比其他南北向道路更為壅塞且車禍頻傳。
?
6.由於大量公車、計程車、小客車、機車皆會行駛中山北路，在交通狀況極為壅塞的情況下，中山北路已經成為台北市的死亡車禍路段之首，皆有相關新聞報導

Zhongshan North Road is also home to many banks, companies, restaurants, markets, schools, restaurants, retail stores, etc. The daily flow of traffic and people is considerable. 3. Due to the large amount of traffic on Zhongshan North Road every day, there are often small passenger cars parked temporarily or illegally, and there are also a large number of buses and taxis that stop to carry passengers. This factor makes the traffic situation on Zhongshan North Road even worse. deterioration. 4. Zhongshan North Road gathers many main east-west roads, such as Minzu East-West Road, Minquan East-West Road, Minsheng East-West Road, Chang'an East-West Road, Changchun Road, Nanjing East-West Road, Citizen Avenue, Zhongxiao East-West Road, etc. The daily traffic flow is quite large . 5.There are two central separation islands and a large number of road trees on Zhongshan North Road. Although it can beautify the city, it also causes traffic congestion. Looking at the main north-south roads in Taipei City, such as Chengde Road, Songjiang Road, Chongqing North Road, Xinsheng North Road Road, Huanbei Road, etc., the traffic situation of Zhongshan North Road is more congested than other north-south roads and traffic accidents are frequent. 6. Because a large number of buses, taxis, passenger cars, and locomotives will drive on Zhongshan North Road, and the traffic conditions are extremely congested, Zhongshan North Road has become the number one fatal traffic accident in Taipei City, and there are related news reports ?

鑒於高捷當前已經全線皆可採用MasterCard信用卡與Apple Pay、Google Pay、Samsung Pay...等行動支付來支付車資，而桃捷也將在明年第一季開放信用卡支付過閘，台北捷運與台北市政府在這方面卻沒什麼著墨，所有支付方式還圍繞在悠遊卡上面去做強化，完全與新科技脫節，也跟不上新的使用習慣。
當前情形與問題:
現在不同的人，有不同的付費習慣，使用台北捷運卻不一定滿足他的習慣，僅能滿足部分人的習慣，而降低某些人搭乘的意願，因為這並不符合他的生活方式，非常不便民，除此之外，不同地區的捷運之間開放的支付方式不一致，這對於外地來到台北旅客相當不適應，甚至是對外籍的旅客更是如此，與人、地區以及世界沒有產生緊密的連結。
更進一步推廣:
承上所提及，不同區之間不一致，導致整個行程不連貫、破碎，公車與YouBike也應該盡可能開放各種支付的形式，使台北一日生活圈更加順暢，同時串聯不同區域的旅客與不同長度行程，基於服務的角度，台北市政府應該要去調查當前主流的支付方式，提供除了電子票證支付方式，近期更該釋出一些未來願景與方向，強化台北交通與未來科技的連結，提升市民對他的信賴 ，不該為了增加悠遊卡的使用率或節省系統更新的費用而固步自封。

一、有關所提路線代碼事宜，捷運局係以原規劃路線顏色之英文字母字首作為代表，與路線形狀無關。捷運路線規劃係隨著都市發展持續不斷作業，行政院於83年9月17日核定新莊蘆洲線，當時環狀線規劃係由動物園站至劍南路站，其路線形式並非環型，因應臺北市東側廊帶未來發展需求，捷運局規劃環狀線東環段，並與環狀線北環段及南環段銜接，形成橫跨雙北的環狀線。
二、現階段倘辦理變更路線代碼及顏色，將涉及臺北市及新北市兩市政府之各式官方文件、相關導引指標、車站裝修等大量項目進行調整，恐耗費鉅資，目前臺北捷運在各路線之車站均設置明顯且清楚之指示標誌，提供乘客辨識方向，可避免造成混淆。

357,Public Housing and Child Care Subsidies,358,2020-03-26,設立房價天花板限制房價創新高，減少投資客賺取價差及買房保值之機會,"建議以台北市各區“非課豪宅稅之住宅”近三年成交最高價作為未來該區房價交易之天花板。
例：
假設台北市內湖區近三年0-5年之普通住宅成交最高單價為100萬/坪，5-10年之普通住宅成交最高單價為95萬/坪
未來該區0-5年之住宅成交單價不能超過100萬/坪，該天花板金額每年更新一次。
若未來該區0-5年之住宅成交單價若又成交在最高100萬/坪，則成交100萬/坪的住宅未來沒有任何增值空間，且若持有超過5年，因該住宅下降為5-10年之住宅，成交單價也會被限制在最高95萬/坪，隨著時間合理折舊。
?
吸引房市投資客最重要的兩個因素：
一、賺取價差
二、保值
因為投資房地產就算放著也不會虧錢，吸引投資客湧入房市造成房價扭曲，因此須限制投資客賺取價差以及買房保值之機會，也就是縮減價差空間以及讓房屋交易價格隨著屋齡合理下降
?
利害關係人行為分析：
買房人：盡量不成交在該區最高價，因沒有升值空間，每年該區房價天花板會隨著此一現象逐年降低。
持有房產之投資客：希望盡快脫手，因房價會隨著屋齡增加下降，且房價天花板逐年下降，希望盡快脫手，增加房市供給。
欲投資房市之投資客：減少投資房市，因買房升值空間壓縮，甚至隨著時間減少價值，房產投資需求降低。
?
打房政策常見風險評估：
金融機構流動性風險：因房價並非迅速下跌而是隨著時間緩慢降低，不會造成銀行的流動性風險。
?
其他相關政策比較：
空屋稅：查核成本過高，難以實施。
房價天花板：隨著實價登錄平台房價交易資訊透明，實施相對容易。

有關所提「設立房價天花板限制房價創新高，減少投資客賺取價差及買房保值之機會」一案，經本府財政局（下稱財政局）及本府地政局（下稱地政局）檢核後，說明如下：
一、落實居住正義為本府重要政策之一，並以「單一自住輕稅、持有多戶重稅」為政策目標，具體政策內容簡述如下：
（一）配合中央房屋稅條例修法目的，本府已自103年7月1日起提高非自住房屋稅率，按持有臺北市非自住之住家用房屋戶數採差別稅率，即持有2戶以下者，每戶均按2.4%；持有在3戶以上者，每戶均按3.6%的稅率課徵房屋稅，以適度提高房屋持有成本，期減少囤屋情形。目前按持有戶數訂定差別稅率之縣市，僅臺北市、宜蘭縣及連江縣。
（二）房屋不該被視為「商品」或成為「手中餘裕資金的消化標的」，而是人民安居樂業的必備資源之一。本府政策目標即為「單一自住輕稅、持有多戶重稅」，使民有所居並落實居住正義，關於多戶持有成本提高相關資訊可至本府居住正義2.0專網（網址：https://reurl.cc/vD7m9a）查詢。
二、至有關訂定房價天花板部分，因涉私人間之交易行為，相關限制屬中央之權管事務，本府礙難以地方法規逕行規範，爰無法開放附議，還請諒察。

Example: Assuming that the Neihu District of Taipei City has been in the past three years 0-5 The highest unit price of ordinary residential transactions in the year is 100 Ten thousand / Ping, 5-10 The highest unit price of ordinary residential transactions in the year is 95 Ten thousand / Ping future area 0-5The annual residential transaction price cannot exceed 100 Ten thousand / Ping, the ceiling amount is updated annually. If the future area 0-5 If the residential unit transaction price in the year is at the highest level 100 Ten thousand / Ping, then the transaction 100 Ten thousand / There is no room for appreciation in the future, and if you hold more than 5 year, as the dwelling was reduced to 5-10 Year-old residences, the transaction unit price will also be limited to the highest 95 Ten thousand / Ping, reasonably depreciated over time. ? The two most important factors to attract investors in the real estate market: 1. Earn the price difference 2. Preserve value. Because investing in real estate will not lose money even if you leave it alone, attracting investors to flood into the real estate market will cause house prices to distort. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict investors from earning price differences and The opportunity to buy a house to preserve its value, that is, to reduce the price difference and allow the house transaction price to decline reasonably with the age of the house ?Behavior Analysis of Stakeholders: Buyers: Try not to sell at the highest price in the area, because there is no room for appreciation, and the ceiling of house prices in this area will decrease year by year with this phenomenon. Investors who hold real estate: hope to sell as soon as possible, because the house price will decrease with the age of the house, and the ceiling of house price is falling year by year, hope to sell as soon as possible to increase the supply of the housing market. Investors who want to invest in the real estate market: reduce investment in the real estate market, because the appreciation space for buying a house is compressed, and even the value decreases over time, and the demand for real estate investment decreases. ? Common risk assessment of housing policy: Liquidity risk of financial institutions: Since housing prices do not fall rapidly but slowly decrease over time, it will not cause liquidity risk of banks. ?

The implementation of housing justice is one of the important policies of the government, and the policy goal is ""light tax for single owner-occupiers, heavy tax for multiple households"". The specific policy content is brief The following are as follows: (1) In line with the purpose of amending the central housing tax regulations, the government has increased the tax rate for non-self-occupied housing since July 1, 2013, and adopted differential tax rates based on the number of households holding non-self-occupied residential housing in Taipei City. That is, those who own less than 2 households, each household is taxed at 2.4%; those who own more than 3 households, each household is taxed at a rate of 3.6% to moderately increase the cost of housing ownership and reduce housing hoarding. At present, only Taipei City, Yilan County and Lianjiang County have set differential tax rates according to the number of households. (2) Housing should not be regarded as a ""commodity"" or a ""target for digestion of surplus funds in hands"", but one of the necessary resources for people to live and work in peace and contentment. The government's policy goal is ""light taxation for single owner-occupation, heavy taxation for multiple households"", so that people can have a home and implement housing justice.

於PPT八卦版上從今年的一月至今日不含回文，有柯市長新聞討論達819篇，如果含回文討論即高達3185篇，而其中除了少數是在協助澄清、或相關逐字稿外，其他多是由新聞斷章取義的新聞內容。
?
而隨著新聞不斷的重新反覆發酵，我們可以看見現在台灣媒體混亂，甚至有政黨顏色，而光從今年度新聞也可以看見，提問的問題將市長當總統在做詢問，而市長只要一不小心或是媒體記者有心的提問，就會加深人民負面的刻板印象，甚至使其台灣紛紛擾擾。
?
而在這樣的狀況下，市府又需要重新寶貴的時間運用在解釋或澄清上，有鑑於此，故提議於對外活動時，柯市長可拒絕接受記者採訪，統一由發言人對外發言。

2020/05/19小巿民進入台北巿立圖書館大同分館，依規拿出裝有悠遊聯名卡內含借閱證之短夾，欲刷悠遊卡機進行實名制，但，本人只看到條碼槍，此時，門口量額溫人員一直要求拿出卡片來刷條碼，但，卡片並沒有條碼?櫃台人員不出聲幫忙，小巿民勉為拿出卡片，不料量額溫人員卻向櫃台人員說：VISA可以嗎?
?
小巿民倍感羞辱!
?
自去年7月起，該館已停發個人實體借閱證，改為和悠遊卡結合，量額溫人員有可能不知嗎?且，只放置條碼槍在櫃台明顯處，讓民眾手足無措。

隔日520向該分館主任林oo反應，她竟然在電話中對小巿民怒叫：我跟你沒有什麼好說的!!
?
小巿民和林主任素昧平生，她卻莫名在今年2/14及3月中在櫃台恕瞪小巿民，小巿民後來才知道她的身份，如今，又向小巿民叫囂，一付幹架動刀動槍血流成河之仇恨對立，令人遺憾。

1.洪oo館長長期針對特定民眾迫害，並向上級單位北巿教育局及該館員工聲稱小巿民不理性，暗示精神異常，導向所言皆不可信，該局也官官相護，未給予小巿民合法協助。
2.今年已是109年，該館居然可以沿用洪oo館長107年4月18日逕自簽准違法違憲之行政處分(職權命令)再度回絕本人合法合情合理之陳情(W10-1090219-00157、W10-1090521-00464)，其法源依據只是”臺北市政府及所屬各機關處理人民陳情案件注意事項第12點第1款但書”(法規命令)，該條文沒有期限、沒有最後陳述意見、缺乏法律明確原則-何謂大量?沒有標準，完全自由心證、也無法阻止單位人員故意不回應民眾而造成一再陳情等…。)
3.洪oo館長將本人所有非屬陳情之基本讀者服務的來電、e-mail、FB留言、紙條等，皆一律計算成陳情案，足證自比為朕，一切他說了算。
4.今由林主任、量額溫人員等之言行，足證洪oo館長濫權，就是要小巿民永離北巿圖，無法行使人民基本權利。他的員工不理性叫囂、羞辱，對照他向世人宣稱小巿民不理性，州官放火不過如此。",109年05月26日,其他,檢核不通過,提案內容尚非市政建設發展等公共事務，爰不開放附議,"親愛的民眾：您好!

新北因道路狹小，所以發現在這幾年前已陸續取消禁行機車道；而台北市現在是某些路段有取消，有些路段仍不人性的任由機車族暴露於高度危險中。尤其承德路三段後，明明右轉車流多，公車、客運也多，常於下班尖峰時刻所有車流擁擠在外側兩個車道，但內側兩道則車輛寥寥無幾，機車族不想被困於外側車道，常冒著被偷拍、被檢舉的風險，硬著頭皮騎於禁行機車道上，只為了想閃躲無數公車、客運為了上下車乘客而恣意外切內擠，險象環生。
請問，在低速道路上，為什麼機車不能行駛於內側車道？卻要冒著生命危險與公車、客運、計程車等隨時要外切的車種爭道？有沒有想過，其實內側車道遠比外側車道來的安全？",109年06月01日,交通運輸,檢核不通過,現行法令已有相關規範且窒礙難行者,"親愛的民眾：您好!

?
本人常常經過承德路二段及三段，
?
以前南京西路跟承德路交叉口也有一個行人天橋，但是使用的行人較少，而且年久失修，台北市政府在多年前已經將其拆除，
?
該天橋拆除後，由於沒有樓梯及橋墩的阻礙，人行道更為寬敞，且街景看起來也較為美觀，不再有雜亂的鋼筋水泥，換來的是一片乾淨的天際線。
?
由於民權西路跟承德路的交叉口也有一座天橋，但是多年來行人使用的頻率較低，即便是下雨，由於上下樓梯有滑倒的危險，所以雨天時使用的行人也不多，
?
且該天橋的四個橋柱及樓梯占地廣大，拆除後可以使四個人行道轉彎處更為寬敞。
?
基於美化市容的本意，過多的天橋不但沒有幫助到行人，反而使台北的市容更加雜亂，且拆除天橋可以節省往後的維護費用，故本人提出拆除民權西路及承德路交叉口的行人天橋的提議。
?
?
如為何執行、
?
詳細工程由台北市政府與工務局及交通局來評估規劃。

?
問題癥結點等，
?
?
1.行人天橋使用頻率低，有礙市容發展。
2.橋墩及樓梯占地廣大，有礙行人及U bike的通行。
3.維護天橋需要經費，拆除後不只可以美化市容，更可以節省地方政府的開銷。

(1) 市場空間部份：若要設置冰櫃或其他硬體，可能會影響目前攤商進出貨動線和倉儲理貨區域，市場可能沒有足夠閒置空間。
(2) 攤商意願部份：由於每位攤商的攤位規劃、客戶層、產品特性、風險與成本都不同，市場自治會恐無法意見整合。
3. 由於目前市場上，已有眾多民間業者提供類似服務(例如Uber eats、熊貓外送、有無外送等)，基於市場公平競爭原則，故不宜由政府為特定方案主動推動並召開試辦討論。建議採市場經濟精神，由提供類似服務的廠商，自行與有意願的攤商和市場自治會接洽媒合，在市場價格機能運作下，透過廠商-攤商-消費者自願交易行為，不僅大家互惠互利，並達到資源最有效率配置。

分析 1. 無論是108課堂還是103課綱學習歷程或備審資料等都是為了面試讓面試官了解我們 因此我認為：可以不要把學習歷程做的那麼壓迫，搞的好像一定要在期限內做出某個效果。出發點好，但其歷程的制度有時間限制，使良好的制度變形。應保留學習歷程，但取消他的時限性 好處 （1）讓學生有自由決定學習與是否展現和如何展現的空間 （2）改善了學生每學期都要忙著上傳，每科都要做出成果的壞處，也更能讓學生專注於自己有興趣的科目 （3）學習歷程取代備審資料的想法不錯，改善了很多人都趕在高三才補上面試資料的壞處，但是他的時限性卻帶給學生極大的不便
2. 108課綱真正的亂源分析 （1）不斷砍殺課本內容，應把更深入的東西從國中按著興趣選科排入加深學習，減輕高中壓力 （2）指考名額的限縮 利用本身資質沒有很好卻選擇了分數較低的高中漏洞走繁星，使繁星制度過度扭曲 應降低繁星名額，把名額留給那些真正在高中認真K書且培養興趣的指考生和 學測生，唯有真正努力過的方能進入自己想進入符合興趣的大學。

導致大量的機車格被占據，但也沒有人敢去移動就怕犯法被告，
?
最後就是很多機車沒有地方停，

只好違停在騎樓下面，或是違停在紅黃線內。

有關「可否禁止腳踏車停在機車格內？」之提案，本府交通局、環保局回復如下：
一、依「道路交通管理處罰條例」第69條第1項第1款及「道路交通安全規則」第 131 條規定，在未設置自行車停車設施之處所，自行車得比照大型重型機車以外之機車停放，意即自行車（腳踏自行車、電動輔助自行車、電動自行車）可停放機車停車格內。
二、惟考量機車停車格位收費係為提高停車格位周轉率，為使機車使用族群更易找到車位，自106年8月1日起，本市路邊機車收費停車格位禁止停放自行車，違者將依「臺北市處理妨礙道路交通車輛自治條例」第4條第1項第1款規定移置保管。
三、另查報廢棄自行車業務係由環保局係依「道路交通管理處罰條例」第82-1條及「占用道路廢棄車輛認定基準及查報處理辦法」等相關規定辦理，「道路」上自行車達廢棄標準，則於車身明顯處張貼公告，如7日後無人認領，則逕予清除。路面停車格屬於道路交通管理處罰條例規定之「道路」範圍，故路面停車格內之廢棄自行車得予查報、清除。環保局每日皆由各區清潔隊派員巡視轄內巷道、道路上自行車，如達廢棄標準則依前述規定辦理，以105~109年9月止為例，計清除60,637輛。

二、所提議於松柏大樓設置出入口一節，經評估因穿越百齡橋會有施工期間交通維持困難、地下通道太長（約180公尺）及工程經費（約2.8億）不在原核定捷運建設經費額度內等因素 ，經評估納入捷運工程中辦理有困難。 有關松柏大樓已向都市更新處申請「臺北市公辦都市更新2.0專案試辦計畫」，後續本府將依作業流程進行審核評估。

二、行人專用時相可將人車通行時間完全分離，惟須提供行人專用時相通行時間，使既有人車通行時間減少並增加紅燈等待時間等影響，以對角長度35公尺路口為例，須設置40秒以上供行人通行，即車流通行時間將減少40秒，行人等候紅燈時間增加至160秒，若於服務水準較低路段實施將使壅塞情形更加嚴峻。

The proposal on ""Street Arcade Clearance"" has been reviewed by the Traffic Bureau and the Police Department, and the reply is as follows: 1. According to the ""Road Traffic Management Penalty Regulations"" 3 article, article 55 Article and Article 56 The article stipulates that sidewalks and arcades are for pedestrians to pass through, and parking of vehicles is prohibited, which may be banned according to law. If the locomotive is parked illegally, the law enforcement agency can ban it and report it according to law. In the early days, there was insufficient parking space attached to buildings in this city, which led to the inability to fully internalize the parking demand for motorcycles, and the public still used to park their vehicles on arcades and sidewalks, so the parking management office came from the Republic of China 88For large commercial areas with frequent commercial activities, traffic stations and road sections where local public opinion has consensus, the measures of ""motorcycles exiting arcades and sidewalks"" will be implemented in a ""gradually promoted"" manner, by planning reasonable alternative parking spaces and setting up no-stop signs and on-the-spot publicity and other means are included in the scope of ""strengthening law enforcement"" to gradually improve the problem of random parking of motorcycles. 2. The traffic inspection and banning work by the police officers under the police station is based on the promulgation of various traffic violation banning procedures and road traffic management punishment regulations issued by the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior. Public driving order and safety is the purpose of law enforcement. In order to ensure and maintain road traffic safety and smoothness, when any incidents of violation of road traffic management are found, the police officers on duty shall prepare tickets and issue reports according to the law according to the different facts of the violation. 3. Another ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Penalties"" 3According to Article 1, roads refer to highways, streets, alleys, squares, arcades, corridors or other places for public traffic.

目前信義快速道路為三線道，木柵往信義區方向除了公車/計程車專用道之外，另外兩道亦有分別限制往信義路五段及信義路六段及松德路。每日早上用路尖峰時段，三道中僅有中間往信義路五段雍塞嚴重，往信義路六段及松德路方向則相對順暢。值得注意的是，公車/計程車專用道使用率低落，造成三線道中僅有中間往信義路五段方向的車道擁擠不堪。
且，公車/計程車專用道實行多年，以使用率觀察，對於用路人增加選擇公共交通工具的效益低落。且因專用道使用效率偏低，更因排擠效應嚴重造成其他線道壅塞。因此建議廢除信義快速道路公車/計程車專用道。

考量本府推動大眾運輸優先政策及大型活動疏運旅次效能，若廢除該專用道或以調撥方式開放該車道供一般車輛行駛，恐將使大眾運輸於行經該路段時更加困難而減少民眾搭乘之使用率，另於離峰期間之一般車道無論進城及出城方向均能維持一定之車流順暢，爰經評估仍宜維持現況，保留該大眾運輸專用道供大客車及計程車使用。

一、查內科壅塞原因為尖峰時段瞬間車流湧入，交通量大於道路容量，及國道高速公路主線回堵至平面等情形；實施車道分流尚無法有效紓解車流，且單一車道無法容納所有欲上交流道之車流，將導致排隊車量溢流至各巷弄，加劇壅塞之情形。
二、另車牌管制車輛行駛之車道一事，考量無法實際掌握每日所有上路車輛之車牌，車道分配恐無法平均分散車流，且實務上恐有窒礙難行之處，亦難以改善壅塞情形。

The new crown pneumonia broke out and spread again this year in Taoyuan, Shuangbei, Central, parts of Kaohsiung, and outlying islands. However, human lives are passing away quickly. Many prosperous and important areas in the north have suffered severe epidemics. We cannot guarantee or predict the same thing , when will it repeat ?The new crown pneumonia vaccine is like a strategic material in the future economic life. Not only medical personnel, police and firefighters need to be vaccinated, but the central government has always emphasized that the general public needs to be vaccinated and has scheduled a schedule for more than half of the people to be vaccinated. If the donated vaccines can’t enter Taiwan before reviewing, but review first and then evaluate whether to come to Taiwan to receive donations, I feel that I was abandoned by the central government as a non-medical, police, and epidemic prevention personnel, and I’m also afraid that the central government will force even religious groups to give up. The life and property of the general public also feel that the deceased should not be sacrificed in vain, and because of mediocrity in non-medical police and epidemic prevention, they may face neglect or abandonment by the central government, or be forced by various restrictions of the central government Religious groups or benevolent donors must ignore or abandon their non-medical police and epidemic prevention professions, and must help themselves to raise more cases. Vaccines that have passed international certification have been vaccinated by at least tens of millions or millions of people so far, and have obtained international certification. The central government has always reminded us that we have good pride factors of democracy and freedom. In order to strive for more opportunities to choose other internationally certified brands for vaccination, and to increase the number of ordinary civilians who are not medical, police, and epidemic-fighting professionals, and I am prone to allergies, I would like to suggest it online. 2. Local governments should set up internationally certified COVID-19 vaccine recipients for donations/ At the donation window, such vaccines can all arrive at the Taiwan airport first and must be handed over to the central government for overall distribution and review, and are not allowed to be administered by themselves, so as to avoid the central government’s refusal to accept the donation. The central government may feel that there was no such window before, but it does not mean that all the people do not think that there will never be such a window in the future. 2021 Year 6 The sooner the better, the local government can designate which brands have passed the international certification according to the needs ( like : German original factory BNT/ Johnson /AZ/ Modena ...) Donations can only be accepted, or the local government can designate the brand and production place according to the needs of the central government /Only where the assembly site is located can the donated vaccines be accepted and handed over to the central government, in case the central government refuses to accept the donation; 3. The donated vaccines that have passed the international certification of the brand designated by the local government can first arrive at Taiwan’s international or domestic airports or to After the ice is preserved near the airport, it will be handed over to the central government and distributed after review by the central government. After the approval of the central government, the vaccines that are not suitable for medical, police, and fire-fighting personnel are required to be evaluated by the central government to provide vaccinations for other general occupations or specific occupations at their own expense.

( Unless other countries insist on donating to them ) . 4. For the donated vaccines of the internationally certified brands designated by the local government, if the non-central government has signed a contract with the original factory, the purchaser may sign the contract with the original vaccine factory in the name of a non-state agency designated by the central or local government, or be approved by the central or local government name of religious group ( like :Fo Guang Shan / International Buddhist Light Association / Chinese Federation of International Buddha's Light Association ...) Vaccines obtained after contracting with the original vaccine factory and non-national purchasers can first arrive at Taiwan’s international or domestic airports or keep ice near the airports, and wait for the central government to collect and review them in full, and upon arrival in Taiwan 3 Within a few days, the local government must notify the central government of the arrival of the donated vaccine to the storage place in Taiwan. 5. In the future, the popularization of domestic vaccines will make this window useless, and it can also be used as a window for donating vaccines to other countries. Sixth, there should be more and wiser people, come to think of a good plan that non-states can also receive donated vaccines for COVID-19 that have passed the international certification, and they can arrive at the Taiwan airport first, and then talk about other good plans. After all, the government says epidemic prevention It is regarded as combating the new crown pneumonia that endangers national security and other propaganda texts, avoiding the situation that vaccines that can be donated to Taiwan, under the guise of various names, are not allowed to be vaccinated by medical, police and fire-fighting personnel, and even the general public of other occupations, help The central government has achieved the goal of more than half of the people receiving certified vaccines as soon as possible and with peace of mind.??", 110 Year 06 moon 01 day, medical food health, Check failed,," dear people : Hello !

432,Education innovation in Taiwan,432,2021-06-22,高中以下校內測驗無紙化,"議題背景：
當前國內之高中以下各級學校之考試測驗多以紙本測驗為主，不僅大量耗費自然資源，其試卷重複使用性也不高。考慮到此一措施對環保以及經費皆有一定程度的負擔，故提議從高中以下各級學校施行測驗無紙化，以達到環保及經濟效益。
現況問題：
1.環保問題：現今地球暖化嚴重，而森林面積的減少是一大要因。造紙業是消耗森林資源相當大的一個產業。依傳統砍樹造紙的方式，每製造一公噸的用紙，需砍伐24株高度約12公尺，直徑約15至20公分的樹木。除了原物料樹木資源的消耗外，造紙所還需要耗費不少的能源，包括大量的水、電力及燃料，不僅相當消耗能源，其製程更造成一定程度的汙染，例如汙水排放、燃煤廢氣排放。而不當的砍伐樹林除了消耗資源與能源，更會對生態造成難以回復的傷害。如果能減少紙類的使用，便可大量減少對環境的負面影響，促進永續發展。
2.經濟問題：現今高中以下各級公立學校多採用紙本測驗，國家級考試之測驗亦然。這些考試累積所耗費的紙資源相當之大，而購買這些紙張所消耗的經費支出也相當可觀。此外近年紙漿價格一再上漲，因此投注於紙張的花費未來只會一再增高。這些成本計算到國民的稅金裡，最終皆由全民共同負擔。故如果能減少在紙類上的耗費成本，這些稅金就可以在其他領域做更好的投資與運用。
相關案例：
1.Manipal University在2017年9月新學期，開始將平板電腦納入考試，這項數位計畫，將幫助該大學每年節省300萬份紙張，而在當時新制度的啟用，也吸引了一些邦加羅爾的大學跟進使用，如PES University以及Maharani Lakshmi Ammanni College for Women。而這些設備也採用了新的螢幕，讓學生寫作起來的感覺與在紙張上書寫類似，並且降低光線，以保護學生眼睛。為了防止作弊，這個螢幕也限制了學生的視角。　
2.AP考試(Advanced Placement)是College Board (也就是 SAT 的出題機構)所創立的一套大學先修課程系統，讓學生在高中能預修大學課程。通過AP考試後，可折抵大學學分，也有助於往後大學的教育，可比其他學生事半功倍，對於課程內容比較熟稔。College Board更新了2021年AP考試的變化，提供包含全部知識點的線上考試，由學校統一安排或授權學生在家考試。線上考試將在電腦上進行，不能在手機或平板上進行。無論是在學校還是在家裡，所有的線上考試都會保證公平和安全。例如：參加線上考試的學生將無法返回到已回答的問題，或是返回或者跳轉到未回答的問題、線上考試將全球統一時間開始等。
3.美國NCLEX-RN(註冊護士執照)考試，自1994年4月起，從傳統的紙筆方式轉變為採電腦適性測驗（Computerized Adaptive Test，簡稱CAT）的方式，並且全國統一。所以全美的各大城市皆設有CAT的考試中心，採用電子測驗，因此護理師須親自赴美參加考試。但自2005年1月後，可以選擇非美國本土或屬地考試。電腦可以針對考生答題的反應，隨時判斷並調整考題程度，有多重選擇題、填空題、連連看與圖片題等多樣化的題型。
4.臺北市政府工務局大地工程處2015年推動電子公文並簡化流程，公文時效由發文到存查各減少19%與38%，公文品質沒有降低，也可以減少儲存空間。其電子公文佔比從六月的60%增加到八月的89%，顯示這是個成功的案例。 5.北京協和醫學院無紙化OSCE考試測驗
此系統於2014年北京協和醫學院畢業考試中試運用，基本達到無紙化考試的要求，無紙化考試系統充分利用B/S模式的特點，實現將考試系統移植到網路上的功能，該系統的優勢在於極大的簡化老師出題的工作，減少考後的閱卷統計工作。無紙化OSCE的應用具有良好的推廣前景，是未來OSCE考試的發展趨勢。
6.托福(TOEFL)1964年實施紙本型態測驗(Paper based test，PBT)，1998年改採電腦作答的電腦化測驗( Computer based test，CBT)，時至2006年再度轉型為網路化型態的測驗(Internet based test，IBT)。實際上，CBT與IBT並無太顯著差異，其中的異同只在於考試的順序以及題型的調整，由此可知，托福官方早在98年嗅到無紙化之趨勢，並付諸實踐。
7.金門推動建造執照審查無紙化。金門縣政府自2020年5月1日起推動建造執照審查無紙化作業，以平板電腦搭配WIFI雲端「無紙審照Go」app，線上進行電子建築圖審查，並結合「建管得來速」app，透明化案件最新流程進度。過往常因審圖需要導致紙本圖說多次複印，缺乏效率又不環保。紙本審查也會造成流程非透明化、審照進度延遲的問題。現今改成建造執照無紙化，除了節能環保之外，還能提升行政效能及服務品質。
?
具體方案：
1.電子測驗：將目前使用的實體試卷測驗方式改為電子試卷，以電子測驗的方式進行。由於國內外目前已經有許多電子測驗的成功案例，因此這樣的形式並不會有太大的技術問題。而我們打算利用平板以及電腦讓學生使用，學習國外成功的經驗，將設備的最大亮度調低，保護學生的眼睛。此外，也建立一項監控系統，讓老師的電腦能同時出現所有學生的螢幕畫面，以防學生查詢答案。此目標是本議題的主要目標。
2.以其他評分方式取代測驗：除了試卷測驗的方式以外，可以透過別的評分方式作為評量學生的成績標準。例如透過研究報告分析、計畫成果發表等形式，不僅可以達到無紙化測驗的目的，也可以改變舊式填鴨式教育的測驗方式，以更靈活的形式檢驗學生的學習成果。
3.尋求較環保的紙類替代方案：如果現階段有無法實行無紙化的原因，仍可考慮使用較環保的再生紙或未漂白的紙張，由國家或學校向廠商批量購入，一方面可作為較環保的替代方案，另一方面也可以支持再生紙廠商，讓國內的造紙業往環保的再生紙製造趨勢發展。
預期效益與影響：
1.降低紙張資源的使用，以達到環境保護之效益。
2.經濟上，減低一次性資源的支出，並將編列用紙費用的預算運再在其他開銷上，或投資在其他的非一次性事務用品上，例如電子產品的購入等。學校端，可減少印製考卷的印表機耗材的開銷；學生端則可降低文具用品消耗之花費。
3.線上測驗可以減少印製、批閱考卷所需耗費的人力，大量減少測驗耗費的人力成本，已達更有效的人力資源運用。
4.可大量減少測驗書寫或劃記不清楚、答案卡髒汙等情形，避免造成考試閱卷上的糾紛。
5.電子測驗可以大大提升作答的效率，如遇到申論題等作答方式較為複雜的測驗，學生也可以更有效率且完整的提交答案，讓作答方式更友善使用者。
6.線上考試有多項功能，如可以隨機組卷、將題目和選項亂序、生成不同的試卷，不僅提高試題的多元度，也可以降低學生作弊的可能性，使測驗具有靈活度以配合更精確的達到施測目標。
7.順應國際趨勢，讓學生與行政單位可以提早適應無紙化測驗與操作應用，以銜接現代化的工作模式。
計畫目標：
短期目標：
1.開發設計並測試無紙化測驗軟體：
設計一套測驗系統，並分配部分班級與課堂以班級小考使用系統進行測驗，評估其使用狀況後進行系統修正。初期以學校既有之電腦教室設備，並選用選擇題等較簡單的試題類型進行。一方面使架構的系統逐漸成熟以應付未來全面測驗之需求，另一方面也讓老師及學生熟悉線上測驗之模式。學校可先從較容易實施的科目，如：國文科與社會科等判斷式的選擇題，較少或不用在旁計算的題目，可利用電腦選項直接選填答案，並進行電子考試測驗。
2.逐漸改變傳統紙筆測驗方式作為無紙化測驗之緩衝：
學校在進行學生評量時，升學考試科目逐漸減少利用紙筆考卷測試。而其他藝能科等其他不同科目之需求，評估考量使用其他評量方式計算成績。例如：簡報報告、課堂重點整理、繳交上課心得……等。一方面減少傳統紙筆測驗，另一方面也可重新檢視原有之測驗是否應做修正，以找尋最適合各科之測驗方式。
3.教學配合政策：
在無紙化考科比例升高前，學校也可加強宣導學生精進中、英文打字能力，以利後續電子化考試在時間限制的作答流暢度。此外，亦可加強訓練學生利用電腦課時熟悉電腦之基本功能，保障學生在無紙化測驗時權益不受損。
4.防止作弊:
為了在考試中，避免同學有發生作弊之情形，且師長監控系統仍尚未成熟。我們將每一位學生之考題順序相異，並且希望校方能在座位與座位間增設隔板，以防止有瓜田李下之嫌。
中期目標：
1.適性調整無紙化科目比例：
在學生適應電腦作答之考試形式後，逐漸增加需要以鍵盤輸入作答科目之比例。例如：以輸入法之難易程度而言，先加入以簡易數字輸入為主之數學科，再逐漸加入較複雜之注音拼音輸入之國文科作文，最後加入第二語言之英文等，讓學生能一一適應不同性質考科的無紙化測驗。
2.使用環保紙張供應不可取代之紙張使用需求：
當有不可避免或較難替代的用紙需求時，例如：國小測試注音國字之寫法拼法的考題或尚未具有電腦使用能力之學齡兒童、複雜數學與理化計算的過程、國高中之數學科證明題等敘述性題目，則由教育部或各級學校向廠商洽談，以相對低於市場行情之價格購入環保紙張，像是再生紙或未漂白的紙張等，讓無可避免的用紙也能不失環保精神；希望能藉此一連帶起使用環保用紙之風氣，從產業端吹起環保造紙之旋風，也期盼能透過拋磚引玉之舉，環保由教育做起，喚起民間端對環境保護之重視，以達成多贏之局面。
3.軟硬體設備之升級：
硬體方面，購入足以讓各年級階層(低、中、高年級)輪替實施測驗之硬體設備，如：電腦、平板電腦等；軟體層面，則是完成測驗系統，並逐年升級電腦頻寬，以利試題保密與測驗進行之流暢度。此外，也將研發出一套能由系統自動辨別之切換畫面警訊，自動偵測學生是否有在該頁面進行考試，以避免學生在做答途中出現作弊之舉動，使無紙化測驗具有足夠的配套措施，貫徹公平公正的精神。
長期目標：
1.完善測驗系統，將無紙化測驗廣泛運用在各科目：
將過去各科無紙化測驗之成功經驗統一集中，以利無紙化測驗平台之定期更新與修正，確保系統之加密功能無虞；同時，更將平台升級為一處理頁面，測驗開始便無法中途離開，一旦透過任何方法嘗試開啟分頁面，考試便直接終止。與此同時，校方也將盡力促成各科考試均能以無紙化測驗之方式進行，進而達到以無紙化測驗為主的教育生態環境。
2.提升軟硬體設備功能至可配合全面無紙化測驗模式之程度：
軟體方面，整合數位教學資源，將既有之應用系統雲端化，針對網路頻寬提升、資源整合、資通安全防護與學習服務平台提出行動方案。並結合各縣市政府專業團隊、人才做資源的提供、經營維運與數位內容之研究。而硬體方面的資源由學校提供，使每位學生都擁有個人的應試設備，如平板電腦。另外針對其餘特殊需求的測驗(例如手寫題)，則可引進手寫板等設備，使得測驗達到全面無紙化。
3.無紙化測驗模式普及化，平均教育資源：
資源由校方提供，而針對資源較貧乏的地區，則由政府提供額外資金補助，提升數位學習資源之普及率，讓無紙化測驗成為全民教育中普及的模式，減少資源城鄉差距以及不適應性的產生。
結論：
縱觀國內外不同學術層級對無紙化之應用，我們可知無紙化不論在學術教育領域，亦或是公司團隊營運方面，皆是必然進程。儘管這意味著使用模式的改變，以及龐大經費的付出，但此一環保精神的實踐以及現代化的革新是值得投資的。綜合本提案所提到的優點，我們可見無紙化測驗的政策明顯利大於弊，不僅能貫徹環境保護之理念、減緩地球暖化，更可以達到生活品質改善之展望，甚至對於未來國家的競爭力也是一大助力。?

?",110年06月22日,教育及體育,檢核不通過,,"親愛的民眾:您好!
感謝您的熱心提案，有關「在高中以下校內測驗無紙化」之提案，經本府教育局回復如下:
一、 因應線上學習比例增加，線上評量需求應運而生，本府教育局持續充實臺北酷課雲平臺，並鼓勵教師使用酷課OnO平臺內建「線上測驗」功能，讓教師直接於班級課程內建立「線上測驗」試卷，提供多種題型之選擇，搭配平臺內建的防弊功能，如:評量限時、亂數配題、離開網頁即退出評量等防弊功能。
二、 本府教育局業於109年完成全市236所市立高中職以下學校校園數位基礎硬體建設，校內網速提升至10G，並完成每間教室獨立無線網路； 109年底載具數量已達到小學三年級至國中八年級學生數30%及高中職一、二年級學生數100%，足以支持學校實施線上評量，且本府教育局規劃於110學年度高中職學生優先辦理高中職學生自備載具到校學習(BYOD)計畫，並積極鼓勵學校推動校園評量多元化、無紙化。
三、 因應此次疫情影響，全臺實施停課不停學，本府教育局早前也行文各校取消實體期末評量，改以多元評量取代紙筆評量。本府教育局也邀請本市14所學校實行線上多元評量。為確保線上評量之公平性，業請各校妥適規劃線上評量相關配套措施，包含調整評量占比，安排防弊措施等。
四、 線上教學因資訊科技發達，以及疫情影響等外在因素，勢必成為未來教學之趨勢，因此如何通過此次停課機會，實踐108學年度新課綱精神，發展素養導向多元評量，翻轉既有紙筆考試制度，是本府教育局著重的目標。
五、 您提案所提考量無紙化測驗與操作應用可以達到環保、教師批閱及學生作答等效益，提供有效的發展無紙化測驗軟體及系統，經評估其推動僅限於採用靜態測驗之項目，對於新課綱鼓勵推動口說評量、檔案評量、動態評量等多元評量較無助益，容易形成評量僅有單一形式之誤解。 另考量國小教育階段之學生年齡層範圍從6-12歲，部分學生使用資訊能力有限，需大量依賴家長及教師協助，另且考量學生視力保健，故國小階段現暫難執行該項建議。
六、 綜上說明，本提案因「提案由主責機關依專業檢核並經複核程序暫不調整」，符合i-Voting提案檢核不開放附議之項目，尚請諒察。
謝謝您對市政的關心，如有相關建議請逕洽2720-8889轉6373教育局國小教育科朱小姐、或1238楊小姐聯繫，謝謝!",0,由主責機關依專業檢核並經複核程序暫不調整，爰本案採不開放附議,, Paperless tests in schools below high school,"Background of the issue: At present, most of the examinations and tests in schools below high school in China are based on paper tests, which not only consume a lot of natural resources, but also have low reusability of test papers. Considering that this measure has a certain degree of burden on environmental protection and funds, it is proposed to implement paperless tests in schools at all levels below high school to achieve environmental protection and economic benefits. Current issues: 1. Environmental protection issues: The global warming is serious nowadays, and the reduction of forest area is a major reason. Papermaking is an industry that consumes a considerable amount of forest resources. According to the traditional way of cutting down trees to make paper, for every ton of paper to be produced, it is necessary to cut down twenty four Plant height approx. 12 meters, diameter approx. 15 to 20cm trees. In addition to the consumption of raw materials and tree resources, papermaking also consumes a lot of energy, including a large amount of water, electricity and fuel. Not only does it consume a lot of energy, but its manufacturing process also causes a certain degree of pollution, such as sewage discharge and coal-fired waste gas discharge. . Improper deforestation not only consumes resources and energy, but also causes irreversible damage to the ecology. If the use of paper can be reduced, the negative impact on the environment can be greatly reduced and sustainable development can be promoted. 2. Economic issues: Nowadays, public schools at all levels below high school mostly use paper-based tests, and the same is true for tests at the national level. The accumulated paper resources consumed by these examinations are quite large, and the expenditures consumed by purchasing these papers are also considerable. In addition, the price of pulp has been rising repeatedly in recent years, so the cost of betting on paper will only increase again and again in the future. These costs are calculated into the national taxes and are ultimately borne by the whole people. Therefore, if the cost of paper consumption can be reduced, these taxes can be better invested and used in other fields. Related cases: 1. Manipal Universityexist 2017 Year 9 The new semester begins to include tablets in exams, a digital initiative that will help the university save 300 10,000 copies of paper, and the launch of the new system at that time also attracted some universities in Bangalore to follow up, such as PES University as well as Maharani Lakshmi Ammanni College for Women . These devices also use new screens, which allow students to write in a similar way to writing on paper, and reduce the light to protect students' eyes. To prevent cheating, the screen also limits the students' perspective. 2.AP take an exam (Advanced Placement) yes College Board ( that is SAT The question institution ) Created a system of advanced university courses that allow students to take pre-university courses in high school. pass AP After the exam, it can be redeemed for university credits, which is also helpful for future university education. It can get twice the result with half the effort compared with other students, and is more familiar with the course content. College Board updated 2021 YearAP Changes in the exam, providing an online exam that includes all knowledge points, and the school will arrange or authorize students to take the exam at home. Online exams will be administered on a computer, not on a mobile phone or tablet. Whether at school or at home, all online exams will be fair and safe. For example: students taking online exams will not be able to return to answered questions, or return or jump to unanswered questions, online exams will start at the same global time, etc. 3. USA NCLEX-RN( Registered Nurse License ) exam since 1994 Year 4 Since January, the traditional paper-and-pencil method has been changed to a computer-based test ( Computerized Adaptive Test , referred to as CAT ) and unified across the country. Therefore, every major city in the United States has CAT The test center in China uses electronic tests, so nurses must go to the United States to take the test in person. But since 2005 Year 1Months later, non-US or territorial exams can be chosen. The computer can judge and adjust the level of the test questions at any time according to the candidates' responses to the questions. There are multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, Lianliankan and picture questions and other diverse question types. 4. Department of Earth Engineering, Public Works Bureau, Taipei City Government 2015 Promote electronic official documents and simplify the process, and the timeliness of official documents is reduced from issuance to storage 19% and 38% , the quality of official documents is not reduced, and the storage space can also be reduced. The proportion of its electronic documents increased from June to 60% added to august 89% , showing that this is a successful case. 5. Peking Union Medical College Paperless OSCE Exam Test this system on 2014 In 2019, the pilot test for the graduation examination of Peking Union Medical College Medical College basically met the requirements of paperless examination, and the paperless examination system was fully utilized B/S The characteristics of the model realize the function of transplanting the examination system to the Internet. The advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the teacher's work of setting questions and reduces the post-examination marking and statistics work. paperless OSCEThe application has a good promotion prospect and is the future OSCE Exam trends. 6. TOEFL (TOEFL)1964 Implementation of the paper-based type test (Paper based test , PBT) , 1998 computerized test (Computer based test , CBT) , until 2006 Transformed into a networked test again in 2019 (Internet based test , IBT) . In fact, CBT and IBT There are not too significant differences, the similarities and differences are only in the order of the test and the adjustment of the question type. It can be seen that the official TOEFL has been in the 98 Smell the trend of paperless in 2010 and put it into practice. 7. Golden Gate promotes paperless construction license review. Kinmen County Government since 2020 Year 5 moon 1 Promote the paperless operation of construction license review from 2019, using tablet computers WiFi Cloud ""Paperless License Review"" Go "" app online review of electronic architectural drawings, combined with ""construction management drive-thru"" app , Transparency of the latest process progress of the case. In the past, due to the need to review drawings, the paper illustrations were copied many times, which was inefficient and not environmentally friendly. Paper-based review can also lead to non-transparent processes and delays in review progress. Today, the construction license is changed to paperless. In addition to energy saving and environmental protection, it can also improve administrative efficiency and service quality. ? specific plan: 1. Electronic test: Change the currently used physical test paper test method to electronic test paper, and conduct the test electronically. Since there are many successful cases of electronic tests at home and abroad, this form does not have too many technical problems. And we plan to use tablets and computers for students to use, learn from successful experience abroad, and lower the maximum brightness of the equipment to protect students' eyes. In addition, a monitoring system is also established so that the teacher's computer can display the screen images of all the students at the same time, so as to prevent students from querying the answers. This objective is the main objective of this agenda item. 2.Replace the test with other scoring methods: In addition to the test paper test, other scoring methods can be used as the evaluation standard for students. For example, through the analysis of research reports and the publication of project results, not only the purpose of paperless testing can be achieved, but also the old cramming education testing method can be changed, and students' learning outcomes can be tested in a more flexible form. 3. Seeking for more environmentally friendly paper alternatives: If there is a reason why paperless can not be implemented at this stage, you can still consider using more environmentally friendly recycled paper or unbleached paper, which can be purchased in bulk by the state or schools from manufacturers. On the one hand, it can be used as a A more environmentally friendly alternative, on the other hand, can also support recycled paper manufacturers, allowing the domestic paper industry to develop towards environmentally friendly recycled paper manufacturing. Expected Benefits and Impacts: 1. Reduce the use of paper resources to achieve the benefits of environmental protection. 2.Economically, reduce the expenditure of one-time resources, and use the budget for paper expenses on other expenses, or invest in other non-disposable supplies, such as the purchase of electronic products, etc. On the school side, the cost of printer consumables for printing test papers can be reduced; on the student side, the cost of stationery consumption can be reduced. 3. Online testing can reduce the manpower required for printing and reviewing test papers, greatly reducing the labor cost of testing, and achieving more effective use of human resources. 4. It can greatly reduce the situation of test writing or marking unclear, dirty answer cards, etc., and avoid disputes in test marking. 5. Electronic tests can greatly improve the efficiency of answering. For exams with complex answering methods such as application questions, students can also submit answers more efficiently and completely, making the answering method more user-friendly. 6.The online test has multiple functions, such as random test papers, random questions and options, and different test papers, which not only increases the diversity of test questions, but also reduces the possibility of students cheating, making the test more flexible to match Accurately achieve the measurement target. 7. Comply with international trends, so that students and administrative units can adapt to paperless tests and operating applications in advance, so as to connect with modern working models. Program goals: Short-term goals: 1.Develop, design and test paperless test software: Design a test system, assign some classes and classrooms to use the system for class quizzes, and make system corrections after evaluating its use status. In the early stage, the school used the existing computer classroom equipment and chose simpler test types such as multiple-choice questions. On the one hand, the structured system gradually matures to meet the needs of comprehensive tests in the future, and on the other hand, it also makes teachers and students familiar with the mode of online tests. Schools can start with subjects that are easier to implement, such as judgment-style multiple-choice questions such as Chinese and social studies. For questions that require little or no calculation, they can use the computer options to directly select and fill in the answers, and conduct electronic examinations. 2.Gradually change the traditional paper-and-pencil test method as a buffer for paperless tests: When schools evaluate students, they gradually reduce the use of paper-and-pencil tests for entrance examination subjects. For the needs of other different subjects such as Arts and Sciences, other assessment methods are used to calculate the results. For example: briefing report, sorting out key points in class, handing in class experience...etc. On the one hand, the traditional paper-and-pencil test can be reduced, and on the other hand, it can also re-examine whether the original test should be revised, so as to find the most suitable test method for each subject. 3. Teaching cooperation policy: Before the proportion of paperless examinations increases, schools can also strengthen the promotion of students' Chinese and English typing skills, so as to facilitate the fluency of answering in the time limit of subsequent electronic examinations. In addition, it is also possible to strengthen the training of students to familiarize themselves with the basic functions of the computer during class, so as to protect the rights and interests of students during the paperless test. 4. prevent cheating :In order to prevent students from cheating during the exam, the teacher monitoring system is still immature. We order the test questions for each student in a different order, and hope that the school can add partitions between the seats to prevent the suspicion of melon fields and plums. Medium-term Goal: 1. Adaptively adjust the proportion of paperless subjects: After students adapt to the computer-based test format, gradually increase the proportion of subjects that require keyboard input. For example: in terms of the difficulty level of the input method, first add the mathematics subject that mainly focuses on simple number input, then gradually add the more complex Chinese language composition of Zhuyin and Pinyin input, and finally add the second language English, etc., so that students can One by one paperless tests adapted to different nature of examinations. 2.Use environmentally friendly paper to supply irreplaceable paper usage needs: When there are unavoidable or difficult to replace paper needs, such as: elementary school test questions on the spelling and spelling of phonetic Chinese characters or school-age children who do not yet have the ability to use computers, complex mathematics For descriptive questions such as the process of physical and chemical calculations and mathematics proof questions in junior high schools, the Ministry of Education or schools at all levels negotiate with manufacturers to purchase environmentally friendly paper, such as recycled paper or unbleached paper, at a price relatively lower than the market price. paper, etc., so that the inevitable use of paper can not lose the spirit of environmental protection; I hope to use this to bring about the trend of using environmentally friendly paper, blow the whirlwind of environmentally friendly papermaking from the industry, and also look forward to attracting jade through For example, environmental protection starts with education, and arouses the attention of the people to environmental protection in order to achieve a win-win situation. 3. Upgrade of hardware and software equipment: In terms of hardware, the purchase is enough for all grades ( lower, middle and upper grades )The hardware equipment used to conduct the test alternately, such as computers, tablet computers, etc.; the software level is to complete the test system and upgrade the computer bandwidth year by year to facilitate the confidentiality of the test questions and the fluency of the test. In addition, a set of switching screen alerts that can be automatically identified by the system will also be developed to automatically detect whether students are taking the test on this page, so as to prevent students from cheating during the answering process, so that the paperless test has enough supporting measures to implement the spirit of fairness and justice. Long-term goals: 1. Improve the test system and widely apply paperless tests to various subjects: Concentrate the successful experience of paperless tests in various subjects in the past to facilitate regular updates and corrections of the paperless test platform and ensure that the encryption function of the system is safe; At the same time, the platform has been upgraded to a processing page, and it is impossible to leave halfway through the test. Once you try to open the sub-page by any means, the test will be terminated directly. At the same time, the school will also try its best to promote the examination of all subjects in the form of paperless tests, so as to achieve an educational ecological environment dominated by paperless tests. 2.Improve the functions of software and hardware equipment to the extent that it can cooperate with the comprehensive paperless test mode: In terms of software, integrate digital teaching resources and c
loudify existing application systems, aiming at network bandwidth improvement, resource integration, information security protection and The learning service platform proposes an action plan. In addition, the professional teams and talents of the county and city governments are used to provide resources, operate and maintain operations, and conduct research on digital content. The hardware resources are provided by the school, so that each student has a personal test-taking device, such as a tablet. Additional quizzes for other special needs ( such as handwriting ) , you can introduce devices such as handwriting boards to make the test fully paperless. 3.Popularization of paperless test mode, average educational resources: resources are provided by the school, and for areas with poor resources, the government provides additional financial subsidies to increase the popularity of digital learning resources and make paperless tests a part of education for all. The universal model can reduce the resource gap between urban and rural areas and the occurrence of inadaptability. Conclusion: Looking at the application of paperless at different academic levels at home and abroad, we can see that paperless is an inevitable process no matter in the field of academic education or in the operation of company teams. Although this means a change in usage patterns and a huge expense, the practice of environmental protection and modern innovation is worth the investment. Combining the advantages mentioned in this proposal, we can see that the advantages of the paperless test policy obviously outweigh the disadvantages. It can not only implement the concept of environmental protection, slow down global warming, but also achieve the prospect of improving the quality of life, and even for future national competition Force is also a big help. ?

Thank you for your enthusiastic proposal. Regarding the proposal of ""paperless testing in schools below high school"", the reply from the Education Bureau of this prefecture is as follows : 1. In response to the increase in the proportion of online learning and the need for online assessments, the local education bureau continues to enrich the Taipei Cool Class cloud platform and encourages teachers to use Cool Class OnOThe platform has a built-in ""online quiz"" function that allows teachers to create ""online quiz"" test papers directly in the class curriculum, providing a variety of question types to choose from, and matching the platform's built-in fraud prevention functions, such as : Anti-fraud functions such as time limit for evaluation, random number matching of questions, exit from evaluation after leaving the webpage, etc. 2. The education bureau of this prefecture operates in 109 completed citywide 236 The digital basic hardware construction of the municipal high school and below vocational schools, the school network speed increased to 10G , and complete each classroom independent wireless network; 109 By the end of the year, the number of vehicles has reached the number of students from the third grade of primary school to the eighth grade of junior middle school 30% And the number of students in the first and second grades of vocational high school 100% , which is enough to support schools to implement online assessment, and the education bureau of the local government plans to 110 High school vocational students in the school year are given priority in applying for high school vocational students to bring their own vehicles to study at school (BYOD)Plan, and actively encourage schools to promote diversity and paperless campus assessment. 3. In response to the impact of the epidemic, all classes in Taiwan have been suspended. The Education Bureau of the local government has also issued an order earlier that all schools will cancel physical final assessments and replace paper-and-pencil assessments with multiple assessments. The Bureau of Education of the local government also invites the city 14 All schools implement online multi-assessment. In order to ensure the fairness of online assessment, all schools are requested to properly plan related supporting measures for online assessment, including adjusting the proportion of assessment and arranging anti-fraud measures, etc. 4. Due to external factors such as the development of information technology and the impact of the epidemic, online teaching is bound to become the trend of future teaching. Therefore, how to take advantage of this opportunity of class suspension and practice 108The spirit of the new syllabus for the school year, the development of literacy-oriented multiple assessments, and the overturning of the existing paper-and-pencil examination system are the goals that the Education Bureau of the prefectural government focuses on. 5. The paperless test and operation application mentioned in your proposal can achieve the benefits of environmental protection, teacher's review and student answering, and provide effective development of paperless test software and systems. After evaluation, its promotion is limited to projects that use static tests. It is not helpful for the new curriculum to encourage multiple assessments such as oral assessment, archive assessment, and dynamic assessment, and it is easy to misunderstand that there is only a single form of assessment. In addition, consider the age range of students at the elementary school education stage from 6-12 At this age, some students have limited ability to use information and need to rely heavily on the assistance of parents and teachers. In addition, considering students' vision health, it is currently difficult to implement this suggestion at the elementary school level. 6.

對比新竹市跟台北市仁愛國小的規定，他們的共通點是學校的轉班委員會人員並沒有安排當事人或是當事人的家長出席。若學生在班級遭受到霸凌或是導師惡意針對，而調班委員會忽視其嚴重性，不同意該生轉班，可能使學生抗拒上學或是直接轉學。

二、轉班申請是否通過，乃由編班委員依據學生學習適應狀況及相關輔導紀錄進行是否需調班的決議，考量個案情況不同，不適合強制規範家長加入，惟家長可於會議前之提案及個案會議階段表達意見，但是否調班仍須由編班委員會依據其專業及學生實際狀況進行決議。
三、另依據本市現行法規，並未限制家長表達意見之權利。若家長或當事人有表達意見的需求，可於程序中向學校提出，學校無正當理由應不得拒絕，若有遇到相關困難，可檢具學校拒絕家長提出意見之事證，向教育局常態編班承辦人反映。

感謝您的熱心提案，有關「育兒托育補助排富應改為階梯式調整而非納稅20%以上完全不納入」之提案，經本府社會局、教育局回復如下:
一、因應少子女化，政府以推動擴大托育補助及育兒津貼發放對象、提高給付金額，賡續推動公共及準公共托育服務等方式，落實「0-6 歲國家一起養」政見，本市配合行政院「我國少子女化對策計畫」，育兒津貼部分，針對戶內0至2歲兒童，以優先申領衛生福利部育有未滿2歲兒童育兒津貼，2至學齡未滿5歲申領教育部幼兒育兒津貼；另托育補助為準公共托育補助，每月補助4,000元至7,000元。
二、考量政府財政負擔及社會福利資源之公平分配，衛生福利部「育有未滿二歲兒童育兒津貼」、「未滿二歲兒童托育公共及準公共化服務費用」及本市育兒津貼、就讀教保服務機構幼兒補助，依相關規定，補助對象皆設有兒童之父母（或監護人）經稅捐稽徵機關核定之最近一年之綜合所得總額合計未達申報標準或綜合所得稅稅率未達20%之限制。 
三、為避免地方政府因財力不同，造成政策差異及福利遷徙效應，行政院「我國少子女化對策計畫」經費處理及管考機制規定，針對既有2 歲以上幼兒補助應執行落日期限及銜接機制，並規範地方政府不得就發放金額額外新增或加碼提供同性質之給付，故依此財政紀律，本市亦不得自行發放本市育兒津貼。
四、惟本市以多元方式協助育兒家庭之需求，尚有建置公共托嬰設施，提供市民收費平價之托育服務，此未設有財稅門檻。另依所得稅法，每位5歲以下兒童每年可扣免稅額8萬8,000元及幼兒學前特別扣除額12萬元，即每位5歲以下兒童每年共可扣除20萬8,000元，故建議您亦可透過稅額扣除機制降低綜合所得稅率，進而符合領取社會福利之資格。
綜上說明，本提案因育兒津貼及托育補助非純屬本府職權事務，且現行法令已有相關規範且窒礙難行者(規定不得加碼)，符合i-Voting提案檢核不開放附議之項目，故不開放附議，尚請諒察。

Thank you for your enthusiastic proposal, the ""Childcare Subsidies and Wealth Reduction Should Be Changed to a Stepwise Adjustment Instead of Taxation"" 20% The above proposals are not included at all”, and the reply from the social bureau and education bureau of the prefectural government is as follows: 1. In response to the declining number of children, the government has promoted the expansion of childcare subsidies and childcare subsidies to the recipients, increased the payment amount, and continuously promoted public and quasi-public childcare services to implement the "" 0-6 The political opinion of raising children together with the country at the age of 10, the city cooperates with the Executive Yuan's ""my country's Youth Childhood Countermeasures Plan"", and the part of the childcare allowance is aimed at indoor 0 to 2 Children under the age of 2 childcare allowance for children aged 12, 2 up to school age 5 Apply for the childcare subsidy from the Ministry of Education at the age of 4,000 yuan to 7,000Yuan. 2. Considering the government’s financial burden and the fair distribution of social welfare resources, the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s “childcare allowance for children under the age of two”, “fees for public and quasi-public childcare services for children under the age of two” and the city’s childcare allowance , Subsidies for young children attending education and child care service institutions, according to relevant regulations, the subsidy objects are all parents (or guardians) with children whose total comprehensive income in the latest year approved by the tax collection agency does not meet the declaration standard or the comprehensive income tax rate is not reach 20% restrictions. 3. In order to avoid policy differences and welfare migration effects caused by different financial resources of local governments, the Executive Yuan's ""countermeasures plan for the reduction of children in my country"" provides for the handling of funds and the management and examination mechanism for the existing 2The subsidy for children over the age of 10 should implement the sunset deadline and linking mechanism, and regulate that local governments should not increase or increase the payment amount to provide the same type of payment. Therefore, in accordance with this fiscal discipline, the city is not allowed to distribute the city's childcare allowance on its own. 4. However, the city needs to assist families with children in multiple ways. There are still public baby-care facilities built to provide affordable child-care services for citizens. There is no financial and tax threshold for this. In addition, according to the income tax law, each 5 Annual deductible allowance for children under the age of 8 Ten thousand 8,000 RMB and special deduction for preschool children 12 ten thousand yuan, that is, per person 5 Children under the age of 10 can deduct a total of 20 Ten thousand 8,000 Therefore, it is recommended that you can also reduce the comprehensive income tax rate through the tax deduction mechanism, and then qualify for social welfare.

446,Regulation of Sex Trade and Prevention of STIs in Taiwan,446,2021-10-12,開啟審議式民主會議討論性專區設立區域,"在釋字第666號通過後，我國立法委員旋即展開對於社會秩序維護法相關條文的修正，確立我國採取以專區管制性產業之政策型態，然而在修法後幾年過去，全台仍無任何一地成立性專區，然而各地並非沒有設立性專區之呼聲，如在彰化縣議會第 19 屆第三次定期會中，議員提案建請縣政府擬定性專區自治條例，而議會最後決議送縣府研究辦理。經小組追查後續，訂定性專區自治條例一案交由經濟暨綠能發展處研擬。然事後詢問進度則得回應如考量民風純樸保守，管理複雜、無投資意願等推諉之詞，又如雲林東勢鄉2012 年時經過鄉民代表決議，一致通過設立性專區，向雲林縣政府請願，而縣政府則以不宜設置回應，表示由於性專區沒有完整的配套措施，希望中央先成立示範區，甚至連內政部施政措施民意調查都顯示我國人民有超過四分之三認為可以有限度開放性產業。而地方中央互踢皮球一事早已不勝枚舉，在公共政策網路參與平台以及臺北市政府i-Voting網路投票系統早已有不少議員、民間團體多次投案希望成立性專區，然而在全國性的公共政策網路參與平台回應此乃地方政府權限，臺北市政府i-Voting網路投票系統又以此乃全國性統一事項駁回相關提議，連政府方自己都搞不清楚究竟為何機關之權限，僅僅一昧推卸責任，政府對於性產業之態度可見一班。
然而國家並不能當鴕鳥，看到問題就把頭埋到地底下，性產業推動之所以阻力大，乃是因為性產業可能本身帶有一定程度的外部成本如社區形象不良、房價降低、治安惡化、環境髒亂等，但許多實證研究都顯示了如果搭配良好的管制政策，設立性專區之區域的外部成本還可能比娼嫖皆罰還要來的更低，而居民之所以有所誤解乃是因為媒體框定了社會對性產業工作者的既定印象，居民就會基於媒體報導的此種誇大後的最差情形、此種偏頗認知的受制，採取過當的防禦措施，也就會形塑出越激烈的鄰避效應，加上長久以來我國性產業在政府的積極打壓下神秘化，而當民眾對標的物認知的越少，或是出事的機率未知，威脅感就會被放大，設立性專區之阻力當然也就越大。然偏頗認知的情況通常不是事實，若要解決偏頗認知便需要解決居民的資訊不平等的問題，而審議式民主強調「討論」，補齊傳統民主政治所欠缺之民眾討論的環節，用制度性的手段，創造場域讓民眾能了解公共議題，使民主政治能從傳統的多數決，轉向討論、辯論更加充分的共識決，不僅深化基層民主體制，更能使政策有較多元的想像。而為何審議式民主可以解決性專區的鄰避效應，將於以下論述：
一、風險溝通
利用溝通技巧來讓週邊居民對於嫌惡性設施以及相關影響程度進行理解，在傳統的風險溝通理論中，應著眼於專家傳達真相，並同時宣揚公共教育與技術理性，但這種單向的溝通缺乏對於風險及其社會脈絡的認知，而被學界所不採用，目前主流的風險溝通理論主要是除了解決專業相關的問題外，更要注意財產貶值、生活品質下降等相關影響的風險、設施需求相關的訊息的重要性，總體來說，資訊透明化以及讓民眾理解科技如何被利用，這些都能夠大大地提高風險溝通的效果，進而影響居民對於鄰避設施的接受程度。
二、建立共識
透過民主的協商過程而產生的選址，潛在地可讓各方利害關係人考量不同的可能性以及這些選項的合法性，促進參與者的自我決定感，同時也可能讓更多人支持貨幣性的補償。透過建立共識這個過程，有不僅可降低與風險決策相關的挫敗感，也降低協商雙方的仇視感、對於時間與財務成本來說也是較有效率的做法。?
三、賦權
透過賦予受設施影響的人們權力，讓他們可以有管道可以控制這些嫌惡性設施以及設施所帶來的影響。
四、制度改革?
識別、建立並使用制度結構，來促進並維持嫌惡性設施選址進程的一致性及確定性。其背後的假設是，制度改革不但可以解決公眾、投資者、建商以及決策者在嫌惡性設施選址過程中的不確定性。
?由於性產業是社福設施，期解決鄰避效應的方向應以減輕或消彌鄰避原因為主要方向，因為社會福利設施的設置或營運，同時關乎設施使用者的權利以及更廣泛的公共利益，是一種根據專業知識或技術經驗進行評估後可做成的決策，在設置或營運行為未必對居民的生活環境造成風險的情形下，居民反對的原因可能出自於個人對風險認知的偏頗或是固有偏見，抑或是單純心裡感到責任分配不公的感受所導致，所以為了瞭解居民鄰避之原因，必須納入居民合意形成程序，而審議式民主協商機制，係涵括「風險溝通」與「建立共識」兩種有效策略，是探討性專區設置鄰避效應如何避免之最佳方法。
綜上，台北市政府應積極舉辦以審議式民主理念為核心之公民會議，與居民、學者、性工作者（含場所經營者）、政府人員等共聚一堂，討論出應於何地設立性專區，並且一同設立管制措施，以期能夠透過公民社會的力量，不再讓見不得光的性工作者在社會議題討論的場域中再次被遺忘。
?",110年10月12日,工商財經與產業,檢核不通過,,"親愛的民眾:您好!
感謝您的熱心提案，有關「開啟審議式民主會議討論性專區設立區域」之提案，經本府性別平等辦公室、都發局、法務局、產業局、警察局等機關檢核，考量提案涉及相關議題面向，綜合回復如下：
一、 國際公約「消除對婦女一切形式歧視公約」（以下簡稱CEDAW）規範：我國CEDAW施行法第四條，「各級政府機關行使職權，應符合公約有關性別人權保障之規定，消除性別歧視，並積極促進性別平等之實現。」有關啟動性專區設立的討論，違反CEDAW第六條「締約各國應採取一切適當措施，包括制定法律，以禁止一切形式販賣婦女及意圖營利使婦女賣淫的行為。」此外，在今日歧視婦女的現象仍然普遍存在，性消費者仍以男性為主，且性工作汙名在台灣社會深刻烙印的同時，性專區設立的討論不止違反第六條，且有嚴重加深第五條所指「基於性別而分尊卑觀念或基於男女任務定型所產生的偏見、習俗」之虞。
二、 工作平等與尊嚴：過去，臺北市曾有合法公娼館，廢娼過程殷鑑不遠，公娼轉業極為困難，不乏難以就業導致抑鬱以終者。性工作本身作為一種無法在技術提升，身體直接勞動，且承擔重大社會汙名狀態下，對於身心健康皆有間接與直接影響。若由政府帶頭啟動性專區的討論，容易被解讀為一種對該項工作職業的「鼓勵」。政府被市民期待的是發展出具永續性與發展性的工作，盡量減少勞動對健康與尊嚴的損害。以目前整體社會對性工作本身仍存在偏見，未來短時間內也難以消弭，且又有影響婦女健康之虞。性工作並非具備有永續性與發展性的合適工作，不應由透過性專區的設立變相鼓勵，經評估擬不討論。
三、 城市性平價值：臺北市的性別平等形象在近幾年頗富國際盛名，包括職場性別平等指標認證、加入國際彩虹城市網絡都是亞洲第一。性專區設立，涉及身體是否應為消費標的，此項論辯目前在婦女團體與性別團體內部都尚未達到初步共識，遑論透過消費身體如何展現平等，如何面對性別與身體消費的多重權力宰制等，都將直接挑戰社會大眾對性別平等的認知，破壞市府長期推動性別平等的基礎。
四、涉非純屬本府職權事務：依社會秩序維護法第91條之1第1項規定，直轄市政府得因地制宜，制定自治條例，規劃得從事性交易之區域及其管理；惟同條第2項第4款與第7款規定，自治條例內容應包含性交易場所及性交易服務者應辦理登記及申請執（證）照，均屬中央主管機關權責事項，查經濟部公告之「公司行號及有限合夥營業項目代碼表」至今尚未增列「性工作產業」之營業項目，性交易尚不得登記為營業項目。性專區之設立除涉及本市自治條例及相關法規之制定外，關於性交易場所及性交易服務者應辦理何項登記？如何辦理？尚涉及中央法規之解釋適用及實務執行層面之問題。
五、 綜上，性專區或性產業現階段仍有法規適用或實務執行層面問題，本府考量本案有違CEDAW規範，且在當前社會氛圍及相關主流團體共識皆尚未形成之際，倡議性專區的討論，恐增加紛擾亦難以凝聚共識，不宜透過性專區之審議討論，違反性別平等推動政策落實。本案符合「提案由主責機關依專業檢核並經複核程序暫不調整」i-Voting提案檢核不開放附議之項目，故不開放附議，尚請諒察。

However, a few years after the amendment, there is still no special area in Taiwan. However, it is not without voices from all over the country to set up special districts. For example, in the Changhua County Council No. 19 During the third regular meeting of the session, the councilors proposed to the county government to draw up regulations on the autonomy of special areas, and the final resolution of the assembly was sent to the county government for study and implementation. After investigation and follow-up by the team, the case of formulating the autonomous regulations of special regions was handed over to the Economic and Green Energy Development Office for drafting. However, if you ask about the progress afterwards, you have to respond with prevarications such as simple and conservative folk customs, complicated management, and no willingness to invest, or Dongshi Township in Yunlin 2012In 2010, through the resolution of the representatives of the villagers, they unanimously approved the establishment of a sex zone and petitioned the Yunlin county government. However, the county government responded that it was not suitable to set up a sex zone. Opinion surveys on government measures have shown that more than three-quarters of our people believe that limited liberalization of industries is possible. And there have been too many cases of local and central parties playing football with each other. On the public policy network participation platform and the Taipei City Government i-Voting In the online voting system, many congressmen and civil society organizations have repeatedly voted for the establishment of a special zone. However, the national public policy online participation platform responded that this is the authority of the local government. The Taipei City Government i-VotingThe online voting system dismissed the relevant proposals as a national unified matter. Even the government itself did not know what authority the agency had, and just shirked responsibility. The government's attitude towards the sex industry is evident. However, the country cannot be an ostrich, burying its head in the ground when it sees a problem. The reason why the promotion of the sex industry has great resistance is because the sex industry itself may have a certain degree of external costs, such as a bad image of the community, lower housing prices, worsening public security, Dirty environment, etc., but many empirical studies have shown that if a good control policy is matched, the external cost of the area where the sex zone is set up may be lower than the punishment for prostitution. The reason why residents misunderstand it is that Because the media has framed the society’s established impression of sex workers, residents will take excessive defensive measures based on the exaggerated worst-case scenario reported by the media, and be restrained by such biased cognition, which will also shape The more intense the NIMBY effect, coupled with the mystification of China's sex industry under the government's active suppression for a long time, and when the public knows less about the subject matter, or the probability of accidents is unknown, the sense of threat will be amplified. Of course, the resistance to setting up a special zone will be greater. However, the situation of biased cognition is usually not true. To solve the biased cognition, it is necessary to solve the problem of residents’ information inequality. Deliberative democracy emphasizes “discussion” and complements the link of public discussion that is lacking in traditional democratic politics. Institutional means create a field for the public to understand public issues, and enable democratic politics to shift from traditional majority voting to consensus voting with more sufficient discussion and debate. This not only deepens the grassroots democratic system, but also enables more diverse imaginations in policies. . The reason why deliberative democracy can solve the NIMBY effect in sexual zones will be discussed in the following: 1. Risk communication uses communication skills to allow surrounding residents to understand disgusting facilities and related impacts. In traditional risk communication theory, it should Focusing on experts conveying the truth, while advocating public education and technical rationality, this one-way communication lacks awareness of risks and their social context, and is not adopted by the academic community. The current mainstream risk communication theory is mainly to solve In addition to professional-related issues, we should pay more attention to the risks related to property depreciation and quality of life, and the importance of information related to facility needs. Generally speaking, information transparency and how technology is used by the public can greatly improve Improve the effect of risk communication, and then affect residents' acceptance of NIMBY facilities. 2. Consensus building Site selection through a democratic consultation process can potentially allow stakeholders to consider different possibilities and the legitimacy of these options, promote the participants' sense of self-determination, and may also allow more Many support monetary compensation. Through the process of building consensus, it can not only reduce the frustration associated with risky decision-making, but also reduce the animosity of both sides of the negotiation, and it is also more efficient in terms of time and financial costs.? 3. Empowerment By empowering the people affected by the facilities, they can have channels to control these disgusting facilities and the impact of the facilities. 4. System reform ? Identify, establish, and use institutional structures to facilitate and maintain consistency and certainty in the siting process for offending facilities. The underlying assumption is that institutional reforms can not only address the uncertainties of the public, investors, builders, and policymakers in the siting of objectionable facilities. ?Since the sex industry is a social welfare facility, the direction to solve the NIMBY effect should be to reduce or eliminate the cause of NIMBY as the main direction, because the establishment or operation of social welfare facilities is related to the rights of facility users and wider public interests , is a decision that can be made after evaluation based on professional knowledge or technical experience. In the case that the installation or operation behavior does not necessarily cause risks to the living environment of residents, the reason for residents' opposition may be due to personal bias in risk perception Either inherent prejudice, or simply a feeling of unfair distribution of responsibilities in the heart, so in order to understand the reasons for residents’ avoidance, it must be included in the residents’ consensus formation process, and the deliberative democratic consultation mechanism includes “risk communication” and “ Consensus building"" are two effective strategies, which are the best ways to avoid the NIMBY effect in the setting of exploratory special areas. To sum up, the Taipei City Government should actively hold a citizen meeting centered on the concept of deliberative democracy, gather residents, scholars, sex workers (including venue operators), government officials, etc., and discuss where to set up a sex zone , and set up control measures together, with the hope that through the power of civil society, the shady sex workers will not be forgotten again in the field of social issue discussions.?", 110 Year 10 moon 12 day, Business Finance and Industry, Check failed,," dear people : Hello ! Thank you for your enthusiastic proposal. The proposal about ""opening the establishment of a deliberative democratic conference discussion area"" has been reviewed by the Gender Equality Office, the Metropolitan Development Bureau, the Legal Affairs Bureau, the Industry Bureau, and the Police Station. The proposal involves relevant The topic is oriented, and the comprehensive reply is as follows: 1. The international convention ""Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women"" (hereinafter referred to as CEDAW ) specification: our country CEDAW Article 4 of the Enforcement Law states, “Government agencies at all levels shall, when exercising their functions and powers, comply with the Convention’s provisions on the protection of gender human rights, eliminate gender discrimination, and actively promote the realization of gender equality.” Discussions about the establishment of special zones for startups violated CEDAWArticle 6 ""States parties shall take all appropriate measures, including enacting laws, to prohibit all forms of trafficking in women and exploitation of prostitution of women."" In addition, discrimination against women is still widespread today, and sex consumers are still male At the same time that the stigma of sex work has been deeply imprinted in Taiwanese society, the discussion on the establishment of a sex zone not only violates Article 6, but also seriously deepens Article 5's ""separation of superiority and inferiority based on gender or stereotyping of male and female tasks."" Prejudice, custom"" risk. 2. Equality and dignity at work: In the past, there were legal public prostitution halls in Taipei City. The process of abolishing prostitution is not far away. It is extremely difficult for public prostitutes to change jobs. Sex work itself has both indirect and direct impacts on physical and mental health as a state where technology cannot be improved, the body is directly labored, and it bears major social stigma. If the government takes the lead in initiating the discussion of the sex zone, it can easily be interpreted as a kind of ""encouragement"" for this occupation. What the government is expected by the citizens is to develop sustainable and developmental jobs, and to minimize the damage to health and dignity caused by labor. At present, society as a whole still has prejudice against sex work itself, and it will be difficult to eliminate it in a short time in the future, and it may affect women's health. Sex work is not a suitable job with sustainability and development. It should not be encouraged in disguise through the establishment of a sex zone. After evaluation, it will not be discussed. 3. The value of gender equality in the city: The image of gender equality in Taipei City has gained international reputation in recent years, including the certification of gender equality indicators in the workplace and joining the international rainbow city network, ranking first in Asia. The establishment of a sex special zone involves whether the body should be the object of consumption. This debate has not yet reached a preliminary consensus within women's groups and gender groups, let alone how to show equality through the consumption of the body, and how to face the multiple powers of gender and body consumption. etc., will directly challenge the public's perception of gender equality and undermine the city government's long-term promotion of gender equality. 4. Matters involving non-compliance are purely within the authority of the government: according to Article 1 of the Law on the Maintenance of Social Order91 Article 1 No. 1 According to the provisions of this article, the municipal government may formulate self-government regulations in accordance with local conditions, and plan the areas where sex transactions are allowed and their management; however, the same Article 2 item 4 Subsection and Section 7 According to the article, the content of the self-government regulations should include the registration and application for licenses of sex trading venues and sex trading service providers, both of which are within the authority and responsibility of the central competent authority. Code Table” has not yet added the business items of “sex work industry”, and sex transactions are not yet registered as business items. In addition to the establishment of the sex zone, which involves the enactment of the city's autonomous regulations and related laws and regulations, what kind of registration should be done for sex trading places and sex trading services? How to do it? It still involves the interpretation, application and practical implementation of central laws and regulations. 5. To sum up, there are still problems in the application of laws and regulations or practical implementation in the sex zone or the sex industry at this stage. The government considers that this case violates CEDAWWhen the current social atmosphere and the consensus of relevant mainstream groups have not yet been formed, the discussion in the initiative zone may increase the disturbance and make it difficult to build consensus. It is not appropriate to use the deliberation and discussion in the sexual zone, which violates gender equality to promote the implementation of policies. This case is in line with the ""Proposal shall be reviewed by the responsible authority in accordance with the profession and will not be adjusted temporarily after the review process"" i-Voting Proposal review does not open the items for seconding, so seconding is not open, please understand.

This not only lacks health protection for sex workers themselves At the same time, there are uncertain risks for those who receive services in the sex trade. However, although China currently has free anonymous screening for diseases such as syphilis and AIDS, there are uncertainties in the relevant procedures, insufficient medical accessibility, and sexual aspects. The lack of knowledge has resulted in insufficient resolution of the policy, so the overall screening process should be improved 1. Improve the accessibility of screening, widely set up screening stations in medical units (such as clinics) that can afford it, and avoid centralized establishment in a single area to avoid stigmatization of the area. 2.

448,Regulation of Sex Trade and Prevention of STIs in Taiwan,448,2021-10-12,在台北市各醫學中心、區域醫院、地區醫院設置東南亞語言之翻譯，協助外籍性工作者進行免費匿名篩檢,"縱然在釋字第666號後我國立法者已在社會秩序維護法第91條之一確認我國應以性專區形式管理性產業，然而時至今日我國仍未開放任何性專區，這也導致了性產業地下化之後的控管困難，而性病更是性產業中相當重要的課題，而近年來因為開放新南向政策，東南亞來非法從事性工作者越來越多，2015年泰國人來臺賣淫者僅有3人，然而在實施泰國來臺免簽證以後， 2017年賣淫人數暴增至210人。且該年度被查獲賣淫的外籍人士更高達640人，其中以泰國人比例最高，占了32.8％。2018年，東南亞籍旅客的賣淫人數更是大幅攀升 。而在我國罹患愛滋病的性工作者中，約有四成為外國籍，四成中又有七成為東南亞來台之性工作者，因此如何解決在東南亞性工作者中的性病問題便顯得十分重要 。
目前我國僅提供匿名免費的愛滋及梅毒篩檢，然而對於不熟悉我國篩檢流程以及語言的東南亞性工作者來說，從電話端預約性病篩檢以及實際到醫院填寫問卷是相當有難度的，故認為我國應參考柏林地區性病防治中心之措施，提供免費、匿名的簡單檢查，增大篩檢項目如菜花等，同時無須健保卡，能夠使得非法外籍移工亦可受惠，同時在台北地區各醫學中心、區域醫院、地區醫院設置熟稔東南亞國家文化及語言之翻譯協助接洽外籍移工和來電詢問以及註記有各國特別節日之日曆，幫助醫療人員更能夠熟悉外籍性工作者之問題以及需求。並且在1955勞工諮詢申訴專線提供流程諮詢，以提升外籍移工能夠獲得相關資源的幫助。
性產業在我國有著淵遠流長的歷史，最早可以追溯至清領時期，而從歷史上來看，要完全透過處罰來禁止性交易是不可能的，據此，如何透過行政手段管制性病傳遞才是將性交易外部成本最小化的方式，而外籍性工作者既然在本國性產業中佔有一定市場，自然也是我國應該解決的問題，故只要能提高外籍性工作者免費匿名性病篩檢的使用率，便可一定程度上改善性病問題。
除此之外，此舉對於外籍性工作者的身體健康保障也有正面效應，更完善的篩檢流程能夠讓性病被提早發現並且及時治療，我國既然認為外籍移工同樣是享有人權的群體的話，又怎能將其置於健康防護網之外。",110年10月12日,醫療食品健康,檢核不通過,,"親愛的民眾:您好!

However, China has not yet opened any special zones for sex. In recent years, due to the opening of the New Southbound Policy, more and more illegal sex workers from Southeast Asia have come, 2015 The number of Thais who come to Taiwan for prostitution is only 3 However, after the implementation of Thailand's visa-free entry to Taiwan, 2017 The annual number of prostitutes soared to 210 people. In addition, the number of foreigners caught prostitution in this year was as high as 640 people, of which the highest proportion is Thai, accounting for 32.8 %. 2018In 2009, the number of prostitutes among Southeast Asian tourists increased significantly. Among the sex workers suffering from AIDS in our country, about 40% are foreign nationals, and 70% of the 40% are sex workers from Southeast Asia who come to Taiwan. Therefore, how to solve the problem of sexually transmitted diseases among sex workers in Southeast Asia is very important. At present, China only provides anonymous and free AIDS and syphilis screening. However, for Southeast Asian sex workers who are not familiar with the screening process and language in China, it is quite difficult to make an appointment for STD screening on the phone and actually go to the hospital to fill out the questionnaire. Therefore, we believe that our country should refer to the measures of the Berlin Regional STD Prevention Center, provide free and anonymous simple inspections, increase screening items such as cauliflower, etc., and do not require a health insurance card, so that illegal foreign migrant workers can also benefit. At the same time, in Taipei Regional medical centers, regional hospitals, and regional hospitals have set up translators who are familiar with the culture and language of Southeast Asian countries to assist in contacting foreign migrant workers and calling for inquiries, as well as marking calendars with special festivals in various countries to help medical personnel be more familiar with foreign sex workers. needs. and in 1955The labor consultation and complaint hotline provides process consultation to improve foreign migrant workers' access to relevant resources. The sex industry has a long history in China, which can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty. From a historical point of view, it is impossible to completely prohibit sex trade through punishment. Based on this, how to control sexually transmitted diseases through administrative means Transmitting is the way to minimize the external costs of sex transactions. Since foreign sex workers occupy a certain market in the domestic sex industry, it is naturally a problem that our country should solve. Therefore, as long as the free anonymous STD screening of foreign sex workers can be improved Utilization rate can improve STD problem to a certain extent. In addition, this move has a positive effect on the health protection of foreign sex workers. A more complete screening process can allow STDs to be detected early and treated in time. Since China believes that foreign migrant workers are also a group that enjoys human rights, How can it be placed outside the health protection net.", 110 Year 10 moon 12 day, medical food health, Check failed,," dear people : Hello !Thank you for your enthusiastic proposal.

1.開放水域遊憩活動將帶來一定程度之污染，影響水質及生態環境，為維持公園生態避免驚擾水生動植物，除指定釣魚區外禁止於湖泊水域遊憩，各公園分述如下：
  (1)大湖公園：為內湖區公園生態化示範公園，湖域面積約9.392公頃，其中水域為生態維護區，禁止人為干擾，今年度起委託研究單位進行魚類調查，針對本土與外來魚種與進行調查以作為未來生態維護之參考。
  (2)南港公園：南港公園為生態化示範公園，水池面積合計約1.7公頃，其中水域分成A、B、C、D四池，面積0.2-0.7公頃不等，且為狹長形並與周邊有高差，另湖邊土堤為翠鳥築巢處。
  (3)碧湖公園：水域面積約7.195公頃，因水質優養化議題目前已透過設置生態浮島、自然式湖岸、移除外來魚種等方式逐年改善優養化現象，並已吸引鳥類築巢繁衍，湖泊內水族生物相豐富，今年度起委託研究單位進行魚類調查及琵琶鼠魚生態研究，針對本土與外來魚種與進行調查並移除外來魚種，相關研究可作為未來生態維護之參考。
2.三大公園湖泊均為防洪調節之滯洪池，水下均設有相關設施，水上活動可能影響水利設施之運作。
3.惟臺北市公園為開放空間，目前無相關措施及設備可供水域活動使用，亦無相關救災人員配置，因非屬國賠法天然水域之範圍，本府仍須負維護民眾安全之責任。 
4.地方民意反對：
 (1)大湖公園里長表示大湖公園係生態化示範公園，湖內含浮島且有水鳥棲息，並有水利設施，禁止人為干擾生態。
 (2)南港公園里長表示南港公園係防災公園，水做調洪池用，面積太小，故水域無開放條件。
 (3)內湖區公所於109年5月1日函轉湖濱里等居民1897人聯署書，堅決反對本府開放碧湖公園湖面開放划船戲水活動，其理由為保護湖面安全、生態環境、社區人文活動樣態，且公園周邊無相關配套可供停車，無法容納大量遊客。
三、本市鼓勵民眾於本市開放水域活動之天然公有水域進行水上活動如基隆河流域，南港公園距離基隆河的錫口碼頭約2公里，建議民眾至錫口碼頭從事水域活動。
四、感謝民眾提案，若民眾尚有疑義可逕洽公園處了解或可補充資料再重新提案。
五、綜上說明，本提案因囿於法規、生態維護及當地民意反對，符合i-Voting提案檢核不開放附議之項目，尚請諒察。

Watching Bureau in 109 Year 1 moon 14 Rifu Guanxingzi No. 10930096061 Announcement of the city's natural public waters ( Does not include national parks, park lakes and wild goose protection areas in this city ) The range of prohibited waters for recreational activities means that, except for the range of prohibited waters for recreational activities in the content of the announcement, the rest of the natural public waters shall 36 Water recreation activities can be carried out in both Articles and Management Measures for Water Recreation Activities, but not including park waters. Two, at present 3 The points of difficulty in opening water areas of the lake parks are as follows: 1.Open water recreational activities will bring a certain degree of pollution, affecting water quality and ecological environment. In order to maintain the ecology of the park and avoid disturbing aquatic animals and plants, recreational activities in lake waters are prohibited except in designated fishing areas. Each park is described as follows: (1) Dahu Park: It is an ecological demonstration park in Neihu District, with a lake area of about 9.392 Hectares, of which the water area is an ecological maintenance area, and human interference is prohibited. This year, a research unit is commissioned to conduct fish surveys, and the surveys are conducted on native and exotic fish species as a reference for future ecological maintenance. (2) Nangang Park: Nangang Park is an ecological demonstration park with a pool area of about 1.7 hectares, of which the water area is divided into A , B , C , D. Four pools, area 0.2-0.7 The area varies in hectares, and is narrow and long with a height difference with the surrounding area. The earth embankment beside the lake is also a nesting place for kingfishers. (3) Bihu Park: the water area is about 7.195Hectares, due to the issue of water quality optimization, the phenomenon of optimal nutrition has been improved year by year by setting up ecological floating islands, natural lake shores, removing exotic fish species, etc., and has attracted birds to nest and reproduce. The lake is rich in aquatic organisms From this year, research institutes will be commissioned to conduct fish surveys and ecological research on the anglerfish, to conduct surveys on native and exotic fish species and to remove exotic fish species. Relevant research can be used as a reference for future ecological maintenance. 2. The lakes in the three major parks are flood detention ponds for flood control, and there are related facilities underwater. Water activities may affect the operation of water conservancy facilities. 3. However, Taipei City’s parks are open spaces, and currently there are no relevant measures and equipment for water activities, and no relevant disaster relief personnel are deployed. Because they are not within the scope of natural waters under the National Compensation Law, the government still has to take responsibility for maintaining public safety. 4. Local public opinion against: (1) The head of Dahu Park said that Dahu Park is an ecological demonstration park. The lake contains floating islands, water birds inhabit, and water conservancy facilities. Human interference with the ecology is prohibited. (2)The director of Nangang Park said that Nangang Park is a disaster prevention park, and the water is used as a flood control pond. The area is too small, so the water area has no conditions for opening. (3) Neihu District Office at 109 Year 5 moon 1 Transfer the Japanese letter to residents such as Lakeside 1897 People jointly signed a letter, resolutely opposing the government to open the lake of Bihu Park for boating and water activities. The reason is to protect the safety of the lake, the ecological environment, and the state of community cultural activities, and there are no related facilities for parking around the park, which cannot accommodate a large number of tourists. . 3. The city encourages the public to carry out water sports in the natural public waters of the city's open water activities, such as the Keelung River Basin. Nangang Park is about 2 It is recommended that the public go to Xikou Wharf to engage in water activities. 4. Thanks to the public for their proposals.

感謝您的熱心提案，有關「悠遊卡加入Apple pay / Google pay」之提案，經本府交通局回復如下：
一、目前悠遊付APP可在Android與iOS平台使用。目前所有具NFC之Android手機均可使用嗶乘車功能，惟 Apple手機並未開放臺灣地區使用NFC交通功能，故Easy Wallet APP無法在iOS上提供大眾交通運輸乘車功能。
二、查悠遊卡公司與各相關國際或國內行動支付業者均陸續有洽談合作方案，但合作方案涉及技術開發、合作商業條件等因素，故合作期程無法預估。
三、此案涉及美商蘋果公司 (Apple公司)及美商科高國際有限公司(Google公司)政策，悠遊卡公司持續與其洽商開放使用NFC，最終仍須尊重公司相關決策。
四、針對持Apple手機的民眾可以使用悠遊付APP內的「乘車碼」功能，使用手機QR Code搭乘部分路線公車（車班陸續開放中），另使用乘車碼搭乘公車或是捷運，業者的設備必須能支援此掃碼方式扣款，目前公路總局已有相關補助計畫執行中，由臺灣好行路線、國道及公路客運先申請，市區客運預計是在2023年陸續建置。
五、悠遊卡公司會持續與Apple公司接洽持iphone搭乘大眾運輸工具之方案，若Apple公司願意開放NFC交通乘車功能，悠遊卡公司相關專業團隊、技術能力皆能全面滿足所需，若有進一步消息將主動於官網公告。
六、綜上說明，本提案建議因係特定契約個案(因涉及契約)符合i-Voting提案檢核不開放附議之項目，尚請諒察。
