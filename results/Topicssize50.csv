Stop letting the bicycle rental industry (such as obike) and selfish people continue to be arrogant_The city is very messy, the operators think the towing fee is cheap, and the users think that there are no fines. The laws and regulations are very outdated. Please the Ministry of Transportation and the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior formalize this issue and give front-line law enforcement officers the power to report violations after towing a slow car. Stop letting the bicycle rental industry (such as obike) and people who do not obey the traffic rules go on arbitrarily. It is recommended to amend the following regulations as soon as possible: 1. Article 7-2 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Punishment"" should be amended to read ""If the driver of a vehicle is under any of the following circumstances and cannot or is not suitable to be intercepted on the spot to issue a ticket, he may proceed without delay."" 2. Article 74 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Punishments"", the second item should be added ""In the case of item 1, the traffic police, the personnel performing traffic inspection tasks according to laws and regulations, or traffic assistants shall order the slow driver to move the car to an appropriate place; The police agency shall regard the leader of the vehicle as the person punished for violating road traffic management.""

The rights and responsibilities of local governments”, please face it seriously, don’t kick the ball, and let the traffic order of slow trains become more and more healthy. All netizens are also invited to support this proposal and help second it. Slow train management regulations, our country is too far behind.', 'Please introduce the point system for locomotive traffic violations, and add the conditions of revoking the driver\'s license or criminal responsibility as penalties to improve traffic safety_Are you tired of being wary of three treasures every day? Are you often scared by motorcycles riding on the sidewalk when you are pushing a baby stroller or wheelchair? Everyone sees the mobile gods on the news every week, but you can’t laugh at all? The death rate of traffic accidents in my country is almost twice that of OECD advanced countries, even worse than the Philippines. Among them, the motorcycle with the highest accident rate has no penalty of revoking the driver\'s license or demerit points at all. The heaviest penalty for drunk driving on a motorcycle is only 600 yuan (Article 73 of the Road Traffic Management Penalty Regulations). If a car driver commits dangerous driving behavior, unless it causes death or serious injury, his driver\'s license cannot be revoked at all (articles 29, 29-2, 30, 35, 43, 54, 62 of the Road Traffic Management Penalty Regulations). Basically, it tells the driver that ""as long as there is no death, dangerous driving is okay"", which actually encourages a fluke mentality. And these are just recorded data. Have you ever seen the police take the initiative to ban locomotives from running on sidewalks or locomotives parked on sidewalks illegally? If such malicious car behaviors are added, the traffic in our country may be no different from that of third world countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the relevant penalties, law enforcement intensity, and other supporting measures can be increased to truly improve the traffic safety of our country. The following are my humble opinions, and we welcome your suggestions, discussions, and additions: 1. Increase the regulations on the suspension of driver’s licenses and demerit points for motorcycles and bicycles: motorcycles and bicycles are both road users, and should bear the same responsibilities. In particular, Taiwan has a large number of motorcycles and should be regulated. Penalties for locomotive suspension and license revocation need to be added to ensure vigilance of drivers. 2. Increase penalties for violations: The existing point system, which stops after the driver’s license is revoked, is equivalent to telling the public that once the driver’s license is revoked, he will not be punished for more traffic violations. Therefore, in order to prevent this “nothing to lose” mentality, it is suggested that traffic fines can be accumulated without an upper limit. Dangerous driving, regardless of whether it causes casualties or not, should be punished: If a behavior will significantly increase traffic accidents (such as drunk driving), what we should stop is the behavior, rather than punishing the perpetrator after the accident. If there is a penalty for causing an accident, it also provides an incentive for driving by chance, and cannot reduce dangerous behavior. Therefore, it is recommended that the penalty that is executed only if it causes casualties should be expanded to apply to all dangerous driving behaviors. To deter the occurrence of crimes, not just monetary fines. 5. Actual law enforcement: Drunk driving accidents in our country are no longer the main cause of death. Instead, ""failure to yield the car according to regulations"", ""improper turning"", ""violation of signs"", ""failure to keep a safe distance"" and other items are the highest. It shows that the alcohol test is indeed effective. Therefore, it is recommended to expand the scope of law enforcement to cover the most serious accidents.', 'Formulate relevant laws and regulations to manage religious activities and provide residents with an appropriate quality of life_According to the National Temple Statistical Table of the National Religion Information Network, there are currently more than 10,000 temples in Taiwan, so there are often religious activities (detours). I believe that everyone respects these religions, but these activities often give most people the impression that there is a lot of chaos, public security is worrying, littering, noise, and air quality are affected... (see attached picture). Although the government has relevant channels for complaints, such as the common 1999, whenever there is anything suspicious about religious activities, 1999 often receives a large number of responses, but the only way to deal with it forever is to issue penalties or warnings. When activities exceed the time limit, they cannot be stopped immediately, and chaos cannot be stopped in time. Taking the Qingshan Wang Parade held in Wanhua from December 4th to 6th, 2020 as an example, the following things happened: Before the event started, there was a gang fight. The firecrackers released during the event and the remaining rubbish were not cleaned up by the cleaning personnel hired by the temple, causing innocent passers-by to fall and get injured and sent to the hospital. The vehicles rented by the relevant personnel were illegally parked around the event, or even parked at key locations (school gates, corners), but the police ignored them. At night (after 10 o\'clock), a large number of fireworks are set off in dense residential areas, very close to the residences, which is quite dangerous and affects the quality of sleep of residents. Personnel involved in the event went on the road without helmets. The activity lasted until midnight, and the fireworks and stage performances continued beyond 10:00 p.m. The government units did nothing. All of the above issues have legal basis (Taipei City as an example), but the relevant units have allowed the activities to continue, and the follow-up only hastily (fines), which has no real intimidating effect on the activist groups.

The regulations on the handling time of ""after-school tutoring and winter and summer vacation learning activities"" are completely unrealistic. The Ministry of Education requires elementary and middle schools not to provide after-school tutoring on Saturdays. May I ask, will the pressure on third-year junior high school students be relieved if there are no tutoring classes on Saturdays? In fact, there is no such thing. On the contrary, under the compressed time, the pressure on students is even greater. When the examination system remains unchanged and is still the main way of high school admission, the school appropriately arranges Saturday tutoring classes to help students review the National 1 and 2 courses. On the one hand, it can urge students to review their own review and learning progress, and on the other hand, it can also save tuition fees for economically disadvantaged students. The above-mentioned rigid regulations are in fact incompatible with the current system of admission to higher education institutions. Since there is a reality of distribution of admissions through the examination, schools and students are strictly prohibited from seriously preparing for the examination. The Ministry of Education deliberately ignores and deviates from the fact that the examination system exists. For example, no one would object to the cancellation of early self-rest, postponement of school, and no after-school tutoring on Saturdays. This is because elementary schools directly enter junior high schools without examinations, but junior high schools require a completely different teaching method from elementary schools because of the existence of the examination system. The fourth point of ""Implementation Points for Normalization of National Primary and Secondary School Teaching"" should be amended to ""after-school tutoring and winter and summer vacation learning activities"" should be amended to ""depending on teaching needs, after-school tutoring can be provided on Saturdays, and free participation is the principle"" to conform to reality. The entrance examination system based on the distribution of test scores does not exist because of the selective neglect of the Ministry of Education and the ostrich mentality of stealing the bell. Before the junior high school education examination system is completely abolished, or the Ministry of Education proposes other more comprehensive enrollment methods, in order to take into account the rights and interests of all serious and economically disadvantaged children, the above points should be amended, so that schools can moderately provide after-school tutoring on Saturdays, and the principle of free participation of students should be the most appropriate and most accepted normalized teaching method. Instead of completely prohibiting remedial classes on Saturdays like the current regulations, which makes junior three students feel overwhelmed and stressed, it can also help disadvantaged students who don’t want to take tutoring or have no money for tutoring but want to seriously prepare for the exam to review the old curriculum of national one and two. Students who don’t want to study or don’t want to participate will not be affected.', 'In the 118 syllabus, the problem of poor learning efficiency of students is indeed solved, and the class hours of senior high schools are shortened to 6 hours_In Taiwan, students have an average of nearly 10 hours of class a day, ranking first in the world. However, such a long study time has not been reflected in educational achievements, which also shows the problem of poor learning efficiency of students. Looking at Taiwan\'s current education system, the most fundamental reasons for poor learning outcomes are as follows: 1. Different teaching quality Studies have found that the quality of teachers has a long-term impact on students\' learning outcomes, and countries have also focused on improving the quality of teachers. The ""Teacher Evaluation"" can understand the effects of helping teachers improve their quality, and also help teachers understand the pros and cons of their own teaching methods. If the teacher\'s teaching method does not allow students to learn effectively, then it may not make much sense to spend a long time in the class. However, Taiwan\'s existing system pays more attention to teachers\' absence from work, but ignores the most important teaching work of teachers, so it is difficult to be effective. 2. The course content is complicated. Both are high schools. The class time in Japan is generally 9:00~15:00, while in Taiwan it is basically 8:00~15:50, which is nearly 2 hours longer than in Japan. In terms of education policy, Japan aims to improve students\' ability to adapt to the future, but Taiwan focuses on requiring students to have ""broad knowledge"". The impact of the difference between the two is worth discussing. After all, the scope of study is very wide, and it seems that students can learn a lot of knowledge. But students may not be able to apply it in the future. Even though the current 108 syllabus focuses on literacy orientation and has been revised according to the curriculum, in fact, some teaching content is still taught for exams. For example, high school geology textbooks mention cosmic microwave background radiation, black body radiation, redshift, etc. If you don\'t want to study in related departments and develop based on this, it is difficult to have a place to play in your future work. Is the ""knowledge"" that students have learned after spending time in this way really meaningful? Although the class hours in Taiwan are long, students\' learning is inefficient. If this can be improved, the class time required by students can be greatly reduced, and the extra time can be used by students themselves.', 'Replanning and Adjusting the 108 Curriculum of Senior High School_The 108 syllabus has been on the road for a year, and this year it will be the second one. However, there are still many immature things in it, such as: independent learning time, three extra periods of independent learning in high school, the Ministry of Education hopes that students will use this time to explore interests, research and learn in places they are interested in, but such as the first session last year, the second session this year, and the third session next year. Parent-Child World, September 2020 Issue / Issue 114: Independent Learning—A Survey of Key Abilities in the Era of Curriculum 108), students may play mobile phones at this time and do things that are not in line with what the Ministry of Education originally expected students to do. I hope that the Ministry of Education can re-examine the way the independent learning time is carried out, or arrange interest exploration courses for students during this time, so that students can better understand their own ambitions and interests, and then achieve the original intention of the independent learning time. Repeated/missing courses, students of last year, this year, and next year, because the old syllabus is linking up with the new syllabus, so in some courses, they will learn knowledge that they have learned before or have not learned at all. Teachers may not know that students have not learned it in junior high school and make supplements. I hope that the Ministry of Education can make more careful planning in this regard, and do not use the form of ""bridge-up courses"" to force students to take extra classes during summer vacation, or to stay for an extra eighth period. The Ministry of Education has asked schools to plan the compulsory compulsory courses for each school according to their characteristics and prospects. However, middle school students (advanced high schools) do not know that high schools have such different courses for each school. Therefore, students may not consider this factor in their choice of high school. In this way, high school students may find that they do not really like the compulsory courses of their own school, but are more interested in the compulsory courses of other schools. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can strengthen the publicity of each school\'s distinctive compulsory courses for junior high school students. Schools do not necessarily have a specialized and professional curriculum planning system like the Ministry of Education for the revision of compulsory content. Therefore, the revision of compulsory courses may be too difficult for students, or even meaningless to implement. I hope that the Ministry of Education can restrict the revision of compulsory courses and set the direction for schools to avoid the output of courses that are too difficult for students, and make the revision of compulsory courses more valuable. Learning history archives, I think the Ministry of Education’s learning history archives are good intentions, they can record students’ learning achievements in the three years of high school, and also provide a good reference for university admission applications, but I hope the Ministry of Education can consider whether the learning history archives may lose its authenticity? Is there any possibility of fraud? Or is it an arms race for parents? It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can better plan the implementation of the learning process file, so that it has greater reference significance and value. Most students, parents, and even teachers do not have a thorough understanding of the 108 syllabus. I hope the Ministry of Education can educate students and parents more. Based on the above points, I hope the Ministry of Education can better plan and adjust the 108 syllabus for high schools.']"

However, the principle of necessity in the constitution allows murderers to escape the death penalty. Is this the reason why judges become murderers without the death penalty? The death penalty for murderers with mental illness is also in a dilemma. However, the murder of others by the mentally ill should not make the victim's family feel unlucky! In order to demonstrate judicial justice, the punishment of mentally ill murderers and ordinary murderers should not be judged!! Suggestions are as follows (bold text is the modification): According to Article 271 of the Criminal Law, the content should be changed to: the murderer shall be sentenced to death, and if the death penalty has been determined, it shall be executed within 2 months. If a person with mental illness is diagnosed by a doctor as a mental illness, the death penalty may be exempted and his sentence may be changed to life imprisonment. And shall not be released on parole. The attempted offense of the preceding Paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in the first paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than ten years. According to Article 19 of the Criminal Law, it should be changed to read: Those who cannot recognize that their behavior is illegal or lack the ability to act according to their recognition due to mental disorders or other mental defects at the time of behavior, shall not be punished, but Article 271 of the Criminal Law does not apply. According to Article 87 of the Criminal Law, the content should be added: Anyone sentenced to Article 271 of the Criminal Law will be sent to a prison for mental illness. Establishment of a prison for mental illness: A prison for mental illness is set up to separate mentally ill patients who are sentenced to life imprisonment from ordinary criminals, and they can be punished accordingly. Mental illness prisons must have the same personnel form as ordinary prisons, and must have mental illness-related medical staff to enter to facilitate the treatment of mental illness criminals."", 'It is suggested to increase the penalty of some criminal law provisions so that the offender can receive a considerable punishment and avoid light sentences_Penalties in our country have always been criticized by the public for their light sentences. Although most of the blame is on the judges, the criminal law itself stipulates sentencing, and its provisions are inherently too light. For example, for homicide, if the judge considers a fixed-term imprisonment when making a decision, he can only choose between 10 and 15 years. If he serves 1/2 of the sentence, he will be released on parole. This often gives the public a feeling that ""killing people only needs to be imprisoned for five or six years."" Homicide is the deprivation of the life of another person and causes great pain to the family members of the deceased. It is the most serious crime. If the homicide is only punished for less than 10 years, it is also a serious violation of the principle of proportionality and does not conform to social justice. Therefore, it is suggested to amend it to a felony similar to homicide. The fixed-term imprisonment part can be sentenced to 25 years. Other crimes such as the crime of serious injury and other crimes of seriously killing other people\'s health should also be amended together. The content is as follows, and I hope that the people of the whole country can support this proposal! 1. Article 33 Original text: The main types of punishment are as follows: 1. Death penalty. 2. Life imprisonment. 3. Fixed-term imprisonment: not less than two months but not more than 15 years. However, in case of addition or subtraction, it may be reduced to less than two months, or added to twenty years. 4. Criminal detention: more than one day but less than 60 days. However, in case of aggravation, it may be extended to 120 days. 5. Fines: more than NT$1,000, calculated in hundred yuan. Suggested amendments: In the third paragraph, if the maximum principal punishment includes life imprisonment or more, the fixed-term imprisonment part may be sentenced to 25 years. Reasons: Originally, 15 years of life imprisonment was eligible for parole. After the amendment of the Criminal Law in 1994, life imprisonment must be 25 years before parole. However, the third paragraph of this article was not amended at the same time. This will cause the judge to judge that if the degree of guilt is between fixed-term imprisonment and life imprisonment, waiting 25 years for parole to life imprisonment seems too heavy, and only 15 years seems too light. And for murder, for example, if the judge considers a fixed-term imprisonment when making a decision, he can only choose between 10 and 15 years. If he serves 1/2 of the sentence, he will be released on parole. This often gives the public a feeling that ""killing people only needs to be imprisoned for six or seven years"", and has long been criticized by the society. Homicide is the deprivation of the life of another person and causes great pain to the family members of the deceased. It is the most serious crime. If the homicide is only punished for less than 10 years, it is also a serious violation of the principle of proportionality and does not conform to social justice. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the third paragraph to be similar to homicide. The fixed-term imprisonment part can be sentenced to 25 years. 2. Article 271 The original article: Whoever commits murder shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Suggested amendments: Murderers shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of more than thirteen years. The attempted offense in the preceding paragraph shall be punished, but Article 25 commutation shall not apply to those who cause serious injury. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Reason: This article is amended in conjunction with the third paragraph of Article 33. If the fixed-term imprisonment can be sentenced to 25 years, the minimum basic sentence should start from 13 years. Homicide directly deprives the life of others and also causes great grief to the family members of the deceased. Also, if an attempted homicide results in a serious injury, the serious injury will cause great inconvenience for the rest of the person\'s life, and cause the family members to bear the burden of care, causing great pain to the person and the family members, and causing serious damage to social medical resources. 3. Article 278 The original article: A person who causes serious injury to others shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than five years but not more than twelve years. A person who commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and thereby causes death shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than seven years. The attempted offense of Paragraph 1 shall be punished. Suggested amendments: Those who cause serious injuries to others shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than seven years. A person who commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and thereby causes death shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. The attempted offense of Paragraph 1 shall be punished. Reason: Serious injury causes great inconvenience for the rest of my life, and causes my family members to bear the burden of taking care of me. Both me and my family members suffer great pain, and cause great damage to social medical resources. The degree of malignancy is no less than that of homicide. This article has never been amended since the criminal law was enacted in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. However, in recent years, those who committed serious injury crimes in society used cruel methods, and their intensity and viciousness were more severe than in the past. As for the person who causes death, if he uses serious and cruel means to cause death, it is also recommended to increase the sentence to death. Therefore, this article should increase the criminal responsibility in due course so as to comply with the principles of social justice and proportionality.', 'Amendment to Article 271 of the Penal Code_Proposal content: There are very few sentences that actually carry the death penalty for homicide in Taiwan. In recent years, criminal cases in Taiwan have often been punished too much for mentally handicapped or other mentally handicapped persons, and medical evaluations cannot completely and correctly determine the condition, causing those who are willing to use other methods to evade the death penalty, causing strong dissatisfaction among the families and people of the victims! Suggested matters: Article 271 of the Criminal Law Whoever kills shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than ten years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Changed to Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Whoever kills people indiscriminately shall be sentenced to death. If the death penalty has been decided, it shall be executed within 7 days. Intentional homicide shall be punished with death or life imprisonment with no parole for 35 years and 35 years of social isolation. If the death penalty has been decided, it shall be executed within 30 days. Those who cause death by negligence shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than 7 years. If a person with mental illness is diagnosed by a doctor as a mental illness, the death penalty will be exempted, and the sentence will be commuted to 35 years in prison without parole, and they will be isolated from society for 35 years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime of the first paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than seven years but not more than 20 years, and a person preparing to commit the crime of the second paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years.']"

According to the newly revised Drunk Driving Regulations, which will be on the road on July 1st, if the first offense of drunk driving has a breath-alcohol concentration of more than 0.15mg/l, or a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03% or more, a motorcycle driver will be fined 15,000-90,000 yuan; a car driver will be fined 30,000-120,000 yuan. In addition, those who refuse to be inspected or refused to be tested will be fined 180,000 yuan for the first time within 5 years, and 180,000 yuan will be added each time for more than 2 times within 5 years.

No matter whether the drunk driver caused an accident or not, once caught, he will be fined NT$1.5 million and his driver's license will be suspended for less than 3 years. 2. Drunk driving that causes injury, in addition to a fine of NT$300,000 to NT$2.5 million, will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 5 years but not more than 10 years, and the driver’s license will be suspended for less than 5 years. 4. In addition to a fine of more than NT$9 million for drunk driving causing death, the death penalty must be executed within 60 days to comfort the spirit of the deceased. 5. The penalty for drug driving is the same as that for drunk driving, and the penalty will be aggravated. 6. The standard value of the alcohol test is lowered due to the lower standard. 7. None of the above penalties shall be subject to a fine or parole. Remarks 1. Alcohol test standard value is based on government regulations. 2.

The existing penalties for drunk driving (as shown in the picture) are not enough to reduce the rate of drunk driving accidents. Therefore, it is suggested that the penalties for drunk driving should be amended as follows: Penalties: Drunk drivers whose alcohol test value exceeds 0.15 will have their driver’s license suspended for 2 years regardless of the size of the vehicle. Fines: Drunk driving with an alcohol test value of 0.15 or more will be fined 10% of the total property (calculated from the previous year’s total property), regardless of the size of the car. If the aforementioned fine is less than 300,000, the fine will be 300,000 yuan; drunk driving and the perpetrator will be fined twice; those who refuse the drunk driving test will be treated as drunk driving penalties; 2. Any perpetrator of drunk driving should be regarded as an intentional crime, and negligent injury or negligent death shall not apply. 3. Drunk driving causing death, the sentence should be set to life imprisonment or above, without parole. 4. If drunk driving causes death or injury, the current offender shall be arrested on the spot and shall not be released on bail. 5. Those who know friends who do not stop drunk driving and are in the same car shall be punished jointly with a 50% fine of the drunk driver and a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 1 year but not more than 7 years. 6.

According to the statistics of Taichung on 7/25, even if the penalties were increased, there was still no significant reduction in drunk driving. 7/29 Drunk Driving on the National Highway 7/31 Drunk Driving on the Sidewalk and Injured People and Robbed Xiao Huang! Unemployed man is not the first time to drink and drive 8/2 Drunk driving for the second time escapes and hits the electric pole - 2 times in a row 8/3 Drunk driving man runs a red light and refuses to be investigated But the perpetrator is still alive? Is this fair to the innocent dead? Can the dead still have a chance to live? Cases of ""drunk driving and drug driving"" causing death emerge in endlessly. Why should the perpetrators be forgiven? It is because the punishment is too light that the drunk driving perpetrators will ignore human life and lose money. The law should warn the world with ""heavy punishment and death penalty"" to sanction the perpetrators. It is recommended to increase the penalty based on the current alcohol test standards: 1. Regardless of whether the drunk driver caused an accident or not, once caught, he will be fined NT$1 million, and his driver\'s license will be suspended for three years and he will be whipped. 2. Injuries caused by drunk driving, in addition to a fine of NT$1 million, will be sentenced to more than ten years in prison and the driver\'s license will be suspended for three years. 3. In addition to a fine of one million NT dollars for drunk driving that injures a person, he will be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison and his driver\'s license will be revoked. 4. In addition to a fine of NT$1 million for drunk driving causing death, the death penalty must be executed within seven days to comfort the spirit of the deceased. 5. DRUG DRIVING AND VIOLATIONS The penalty shall be the same as that of drunk driving. 6. None of the above penalties shall be subject to fines or parole. 7. Regardless of whether the drunk driver caused an accident or not, once caught, he will be fined NT$1 million and his driver\'s license will be revoked for three years. 8. El Salvador and Bulgaria should follow the example of these two countries. Remarks: 1. Alcohol test standard values \u200b\u200bare based on government regulations. 2. The identification standards for wounds are based on the identification standards set by the government. 3. The current law does not have any penalties for drug driving. In addition to legal penalties, drug addicts should be punished in the same way as drunk drivers.']"

Most trains only travel through the main line to Zuoying, and then the high-speed rail Liukuaicuo Station will come every hour. However, many people in the Gaoping area are eager to adopt the extension of the main line to increase the frequency, and think that the ""Kaohsiung plan"" or the ""Xiaogang Chaozhou"" route should be adopted. Some people in central and northern China think that the high-speed rail station must be ""co-constructed with the major stations of Taiwan Railway"" to facilitate transfers, and they think that the high-speed rail must be allowed to enter Kaohsiung Railway Station. Unfortunately, the plan to extend the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung has been cancelled, which has frustrated everyone\'s expectations and wasted the expensive intention of undergrounding the railway! Strongly demand: Reject the Zuoying plan: the extension of the high-speed rail using the Zuoying bifurcation must be stopped! Proposal for Kaohsiung: If it is determined to extend Pingtung City and consider the cost and benefits, the original plan of allowing the high-speed rail to enter Kaohsiung Station should be restored, and the high-speed rail Kaohsiung Station should be re-established. Liukuaicuo Station Eastward: If it is determined to extend Pingtung City, the original Liukuaicuo Station must be moved eastward by more than 2,000 meters, using the open space on the north side of Pingtung Station to build a platform. Xiaogang Chaozhou plan: passing through Xiaogang Airport and then heading east to Chaozhou, connecting with the international airport is also the most beneficial plan for the entire Gaoping area! Refer to the Nangang extension plan for Yilan: if the high-speed rail extension is for sightseeing, it should extend directly eastward from Pingtung to Taitung City! Pingtung\'s transportation construction is not just for sightseeing~ If it is not for the extension of Taitung, don\'t rush into Pingtung City!', 'The southward extension of the high-speed rail should set up a triangular line at Niaosong, Yanchao, Renwu, and extend to Fangliao_The high-speed rail south extension Zuoying project approved by the government recently is a high-speed rail branch line plan that runs from the high-speed rail Zuoying Station to the north and then eastward to Liukuaicuo, Pingtung City, about 17.5 kilometers, and the travel time is about 15 minutes. Although this route can go directly to the HSR Zuoying Station, the train has to make a U-turn before going to Taipei. The route is ""east extension"" instead of ""south extension"", which is like changing trains in disguise, which is quite inconvenient. After the electrification of the South-Circuit Railway is opened to traffic in the future, the Pingtung Line and the South-Circuit Railway section from Xinzuoying Station to Taitung Station will be dominated by push-pull Ziqiang, Taroko and Puyuma. If you want to calculate the time and fare of Taiwan Railway and High Speed \u200b\u200bRail, the time for Taiwan Railway Pingtung Station to Xin Zuoying Station is about 25 minutes, and the fare is about 70 yuan; while the time for High Speed \u200b\u200bRail Zuoying Station to Pingtung Station is about 15 minutes, and the fare is about 100-200 yuan. It can be seen from this that the Zuoying high-speed rail south extension plan pales in comparison with the optimization of the Taiwan Railway connection. In addition, there is no bifurcation roadbed reserved for this route, so the construction is difficult. After completion, it will also face the dilemma of difficult shunting. Analyzing the Zuoying plan, the author believes that if the high-speed rail passes through the narrow and long Pingtung County, the Renwu Yanchao Niaosong Triangle Line must be built and extended to the hinterland of Guangfangliao Station to meet the different transportation needs of Pingtung County residents.', 'The government should promote the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station_Origin: In 1987, the comprehensive plan for undergrounding the Kaohsiung Railway (Kaohsiung Project) included the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station. However, in 1994, the Kaohsiung Project was split into an implementation plan (undergrounding the railway) and a follow-up plan (extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station). The extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station has been put on hold until now. In the counties and cities that the high-speed rail passes through, the stations are named after the names of the counties and cities, except for the high-speed rail Nangang Station, Banqiao Station, and Zuoying Station. The former two are named after the district name because they belong to the Greater Taipei area and already have Taipei Station. This is also the reason why the high-speed rail Zuoying Station is not called Kaohsiung Station, so that the high-speed rail can be extended to Kaohsiung Station. The new Kaohsiung Station has reserved space for the high-speed rail, but according to the ""Preliminary Report on the Engineering and Technology of the High-speed Rail Extension Pingtung Route Plan"", the reserved space for the high-speed rail has been changed and handed over to Taiwan Railway for commercial use. This means that the government is considering abandoning the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station? Appeal: The government should re-evaluate whether the high-speed rail is extended to Kaohsiung Station. New route plan. Among them, Plan 1 and Plan 2 will set up a station for the high-speed rail at Kaohsiung Station. Option 1 is technically infeasible and can be discarded directly. Plan 2 and Plan 3, according to the author\'s personal suggestion, Plan 2 is better than Plan 3. Option 2 is technically feasible. The current Taiwan Railway temporary rail construction can be used for the tunnel of the high-speed rail passing through the Kaohsiung City section. Although limited by the existing curve radius of the Gushan section of the Taiwan Railway, it cannot travel at high speeds. However, the high-speed rail also has two major bends in Taipei, namely Mengka Avenue and North Gate, which also cannot travel at high speed, so this is not a problem. The bigger problem is that the construction of the Green Park Road along the line, the construction of the circular light rail Gushan Station-Museum Station, and the national highway transfer station, bus transfer station, and ceiling above Kaohsiung Station must be postponed, but the author believes that a delay of several years should be within the acceptable range of Kaohsiung citizens. The problem with option 3 is that there will always be problems no matter where it exits from. The branch from Yanchao will seriously affect the operation of Tainan-Zuoying Station during the construction period. After completion, it will cause inconvenience for commuting between Kaohsiung and Pingtung. If it is diverted from Zuoying, there will be the problem of back-facing seats. To avoid back-facing seats, passengers can only change trains at Zuoying Station. The Zuoying-Pingtung section is equivalent to a branch line, which will cause inconvenience for passengers from the north of Tainan to travel to and from Pingtung, and is not conducive to the great blueprint for the direct operation of the high-speed rail around the island in the future. The government’s top priority when constructing transportation construction is how to bring the greatest convenience to passengers? How to bring the greatest benefits? Instead of focusing on the required funds, it is better to build whichever is cheaper. Now that one chance has been missed, the only last chance left must be seized. Because this cannot be delayed, and it cannot be said to wait 5 years or 10 years before evaluating. At present, the second phase of the ring-shaped light rail has started construction. The section between Gushan Station and the Art Museum station will be opened to traffic in August this year before entering the construction site. However, the light rail corridor is planned to be on the corridor reserved for the high-speed rail tunnel. If it is determined that the high-speed rail will extend to Kaohsiung Station, the light rail project between Gushan Station and Art Museum Station can be postponed until the high-speed rail tunnel is completed (the missing section in the middle of the circular light rail can be temporarily connected by bus or Taiwan Railway), or the design can be changed so that it does not occupy the reserved corridor of the high-speed rail tunnel. And the construction of the ground and ceiling of Kaohsiung Station will be postponed first, and the high-speed rail platform and connecting switch will be built first to facilitate the follow-up projects and reduce the delay time for the opening of the new Kaohsiung Station. It is hoped that the government can carefully evaluate and make a decision that is most beneficial to the interests of all the people as soon as possible.']"

Later, due to the increasingly severe epidemic situation at home and abroad, and the increasing attention of the Chinese people to the overall impact of the epidemic on the country, relevant measures have become more stringent, such as the implementation of entry quarantine system, border quarantine measures, centralized simple places, epidemic prevention accommodation, etc. The purpose of the government\'s adoption of relevant measures is very clear. It aims to avoid increasing the risk of epidemic transmission due to the movement of people, to maintain the safety of the community\'s epidemic prevention and the health of the Chinese people, and to put the safety of the people\'s epidemic prevention first. On the international front, the continuity and integrity of our country\'s anti-epidemic effectiveness can also be preserved. Focusing on the fact that the COVID-19 epidemic has not been completely controlled so far, there is currently a lack of absolutely safe and effective control and prevention measures in the world. Therefore, in the domestic part, the government can only continue to promote policies and persuade people to avoid unnecessary regional mobility. In terms of the control of the flow of people between countries, the government has also continued to adopt different restrictive policies, such as restricting the conditions for foreigners to come to Taiwan and restricting the personal freedom of returnees, in order to maintain a good domestic epidemic prevention effect. As for the stranded foreigners, although the government has not banned Chinese nationals from returning to Taiwan, the actual situation is obviously very different from the situation before COVID-19. Even though many foreigners feel homesick, most of them can only temporarily suspend or postpone their plans to return to China to visit relatives in accordance with the government\'s policy of not encouraging movement and jointly safeguarding the health of the Chinese people. However, according to Article 16, Item 3 of the Household Registration Law, ""If you have been out of the country for more than two years, you should register as moving out. However, it does not apply to one of the following situations: 1. Personnel stationed abroad on business and their family members. 2. Going out to sea with our country\'s ocean-going fishing boats."" For this reason, no matter what the reason is for the foreigner who has not entered the country for more than 2 years, under the current law, as long as a stranded foreigner has not returned to the country with his or her passport for more than two years, his household registration will be forcibly moved out of the original address according to law. As for the scope of impact on those whose household registration has been moved out, including their health insurance rights, their personal national annuity and labor insurance old-age annuity payments, and the calculation of personal comprehensive income tax rates, etc., they are also negatively affected. [Proposal Appeal] Amending the regulations: The period of the COVID-19 epidemic should be listed as one of the provisos in Article 16, Item 3 of the Household Registration Law. If Chinese nationals have been out of the country for more than 2 years during the COVID-19 period, they should be excluded from the provisions of the Registration Law on forced eviction registration if they have been out of the country for more than two years. According to Article 16 of the Household Registration Law (amendment and transfer of Article 20 of the original article), the reason for the amendment in 1996 stated that ""the service personnel and their family members stationed abroad for business purposes, and those who go out to sea with their own country\'s ocean-going fishing boats, due to their special nature, are added to the second item of the original article. Under the Household Registration Law, situations such as ""service personnel and their family members stationed abroad for business purposes"" and ""going to sea with the country\'s ocean-going fishing boats"" are specific to specific ethnic groups and can be expected. Among the legislative reasons of the original article, they have been identified as ""special in nature"" and expressly excluded from the application of the provisions of moving out registration for more than two years. In contrast, the treacherous and ever-changing COVID-19 epidemic is not only helpless at home and abroad, but also unprecedented in the torrent of history; this virus is so powerful that relevant experts at home and abroad are not only helpless about it, but it is still unknown at home and abroad when it will be truly controllable and preventable. Its level of influence does not distinguish between domestic and foreign, and the impact on different levels of unspecified ethnic groups should not be underestimated. Sincerely, the nature of the COVID-19 epidemic should be deemed to meet the definition of ""special nature"" rather than the two clearly stated in the law. Then, in the case of foreseeable business stationing or offshore operations, it can be considered to meet the definition of special nature, and exclude the application of Article 16, which requires moving out of the country for more than two years. During the COVID-19 epidemic, as explained above, it should be considered to meet the ""special nature"" legislative reason, and should be added as one of the provisos to Article 16. Therefore, Chinese nationals who have not entered the country with their own passports for more than 2 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period should be excluded from the application of the regulations on moving out of the country for more than two years.', 'In response to the severity of the epidemic, the Department of Health Services is required to suspend or cancel the conditional entry of foreigners for medical treatment starting from 8/1._(The following is the CDC press release on July 22, which states that foreign nationals are allowed to enter the country for medical treatment with conditions) The Central Epidemic Command Center stated today (22) that my country has long promoted international medical services. Due to the impact of the global COVID-19 (Wuhan Pneumonia) epidemic, my country has implemented border control measures since March 19, 2020, restricting the entry of non-nationals, preventing some foreign patients from coming to Taiwan and interrupting treatment. Considering that the domestic epidemic situation is stable and there is still room for medical treatment, in order to continue the spirit of ""Taiwan can help, and Taiwan is helping!"", from August 1 this year, in addition to non-urgent medical needs such as health checkups and aesthetic medicine, international medical patients can apply for medical treatment in Taiwan through relevant information and documents provided by medical institutions. The command center pointed out that foreigners who need to come to Taiwan for medical treatment can apply for their spouse or two relatives within the third degree of kinship to accompany them. If necessary, one more medical staff or other caregiver from the country of residence can be added to accompany them. The required documents and materials include: medical insurance certificate, quarantine conclusion letter, entry health certificate (English version of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test negative report within three days before boarding), and the entry epidemic prevention plan and medical plan prepared by the medical institution. The medical institution will submit the entry to the Ministry of Health and Welfare on behalf of the applicant. For medical treatment permit application, the applicant or medical institution may go to the relevant agency (institution) to apply for a special entry permit after obtaining the consent letter from the Ministry of Health and Welfare (see the attachment). The command center further clarified that those who are allowed to enter Taiwan for medical treatment and their accompanying persons are required to show the negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test report in English within 3 days before boarding to the airline ground staff when the passenger checks in or board the plane, and wear a mask during the entire flight; after entering the country, a 14-day home quarantine is required, and when the quarantine period expires, they must cooperate with the inspection measures. Arrange to stay in a special ward or a negative pressure isolation ward for hospitalization. After one test result is negative, they will receive medical treatment. During the 14-day quarantine period, they will be cared for in the same way as suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition, the quarantine fee, inspection fee, and medical diagnosis and treatment expenses of the applicant during their stay in Taiwan are all at their own expense. The medical institution receiving the treatment should be responsible for assisting in arranging the necessary quarantine and inspection measures, including anti-epidemic hotel accommodation, anti-epidemic transportation and medical treatment arrangements, etc. The command center emphasized that while demonstrating high-quality medical services and giving back to the world, my country will still adhere to the principle of strict border risk management, and plan and improve epidemic prevention management measures for those who apply for medical treatment in Taiwan to reduce the risk of community and hospital infections after foreigners enter the country, and continue to check the health and safety of Chinese people. If you have any questions about applying for non-nationals to enter Taiwan for medical treatment, please contact the hotline: 02-2885-1528. Due to the recent slowdown of the epidemic, the government intends to allow foreigners to enter the country for medical treatment. However, the number of cases of immigration from China and abroad has increased recently. In order to protect the health of the people in the country, the government should carefully evaluate the suspension or cancellation of this policy.', ""Immediately/speed up border unblocking and loosening of epidemic control measures_Today (4/1), the Central Epidemic Control Center announced the statistics of the new crown pneumonia from January to March in 2022. Surprisingly, there were 1,266 local cases in the three months, and only 3 cases were moderate or severe. 99.76% of the confirmed cases were mild. Although the death/severe illness rate of confirmed cases between 80 and 90 years old has reached 10%, when the total number of confirmed cases is only 10 and the sample size is extremely small, the threats faced by the vast majority of the elderly have also been questioned. At present, Taiwan's excellent epidemic performance and such a low death rate can be attributed to the efforts of medical personnel and epidemic control center personnel, as well as the self-control of the public. We understand that in the past three years, the outbreak of the epidemic has had a great impact on the physical and mental health of the people of Taiwan, and opening up rashly may have serious consequences. However, if you want to avoid risks, you will inevitably have an opportunity cost. In the season when the global economy is gradually recovering, if Taiwan is complacent, the financial industry, the technology industry, and the international exchange activities of various industries and academia will not be seen. We will not be able to catch up with international trends in a short period of time, which will be very unfavorable for Taiwan’s industrial transformation and upgrading. The opportunity cost of avoiding the epidemic is rising. If Taiwan's economic boom in recent years is to continue, it seems that it should also consider relaxing restrictions on the movement of people. Taiwan is ready. With the two-dose vaccine coverage rate reaching 78.32%, the supplementary rate reaching 50%, and the specific drugs are sufficient, our epidemic prevention bubble is already very strong. With the current mutation with weakening toxicity, the risk to most citizens seems to be like a daily cold; therefore, we strongly recommend that the following measures be taken to achieve a balance between epidemic prevention and economic development: #接接接控 Immediately loosen the isolation regulations. The PCR test regulations before or after arrival in Taiwan are understandable, but they should be replaced by antigen and rapid screening as appropriate (the high price of PCR will cause a lot of burden to vulnerable or ordinary families), and it should be lifted immediately when the global epidemic is eliminated or normalized. # Mild disease without isolation People who have been fully vaccinated do not need to be isolated when they are diagnosed with COVID-19. They only need to manage their own health and return medical resources to groups that need it more. After a while, we also hope to implement #mild disease without testing From another perspective, we will not help everyone to do pathogen testing when they have a common cold. #Relax the regulations on assembly activities and venues Open the limit on the number of people in assembly activities, and implement the normalization measures of the epidemic situation. Regarding the regulations on masks, we believe that except for wearing masks in medical places to protect the health of medical personnel, other occasions are decided according to the free will of the people. What I want to say to the government: Most Taiwanese people are very cooperative with the epidemic prevention measures so far, and I can only thank the medical staff. However, hearing the minister's constant emphasis on the lack of vaccine coverage, the Hong Kong case and delaying the progress of Taiwan's epidemic transition, I feel a little powerless. First, we often hear on the Internet that people who have not been vaccinated say that they will not be afraid and vaccine conspiracy theories, and the government has long promoted the importance of vaccination. If those people continue to damage the rights and interests of those who have been vaccinated at this time, it will disappoint those of us who have always believed that we can enjoy freedom after being vaccinated. And do these epidemic prevention and control policies conform to the principle of proportionality at this time? It is a point worthy of our consideration and measurement. Second, there are many differences between Hong Kong’s case and Taiwan’s case. The vaccination rate and type of vaccination are quite different from Taiwan’s. Ministers and the Ministry of Health and Welfare are also requested not to focus on Taiwan’s current anti-epidemic achievements, because obviously, the definition of success in anti-epidemic seems to be changing. Based on the above, we believe that #border loosening is the goal that needs to be implemented immediately. After continuous health education, mentality building, and final vaccine promotion, we hope that those who have taken three doses can breathe freely around the summer vacation. After exploring in many ways, we have determined that these opinions do not only occur in the stratosphere, so we ask the relevant units to consider it carefully.""]"

The Animal Protection Law is full of contradictions and loopholes. For example: Article 6 of the Animal Protection Law stipulates that no animal shall be abused or harmed, but Article 12 does not restrict the slaughter of commercial animals and experimental animals. The slaughter process will definitely harm the animals themselves, so the two contradict each other. 2. The Animal Protection Law only gives special treatment to certain types of animals. The overall law only protects dogs, cats and other vertebrates that are raised or managed by humans. Other animals of the same level such as chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. can be slaughtered at will, and the law defines the category of ""economic animals"". Purpose to use or slaughter? Therefore, in terms of fairness, the so-called ""dogs, cats"" and other animals should also be listed as economic animals in order to comply with the equal treatment of all vertebrates. 3. Animals are not human beings and should not be protected by law. The purpose of the law is to adapt to the changes and developments of human society, that is, the law aims to regulate the maintenance and protection of human life, and the law emphasizes the justice, equality and objectivity of human society. The protection of animals is neither in line with social justice, nor is it for the purpose of protecting or regulating human life. 4. The animal protection law is not in line with the overall fairness. Many people think that ""abuse or even slaughter of pets such as cats and dogs"" is a very strange thing that should not be done, but don\'t forget that this is simply our inexplicable doting on pets. If pets should not be abused or even slaughtered, then chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and even other molluscs, arthropods (insects), or non-animal bacteria and viruses should also enjoy the same rights. After all, they are also ""life"" and should be respected. Why do people only prefer to protect them? What about animals that should be protected while ignoring the protection of other animals? This does not seem to be in line with overall fairness. Conclusion: My personal opinion is that the ""Animal Protection Law"" should be completely abolished, and the law as a whole is completely inconsistent with equality and the law is too subjective. Dogs, cats and other ""pets"" for human entertainment and companions enjoy more noble protection than other animals. Are economic animals and experimental animals not ""life"" and should not have the same protection? Besides, what is the so-called ""pet""? Animals raised or kept for entertainment or companionship? This is simply a preference and arrogance for a particular animal! And the law also specifically emphasizes ""dog"" and ""cat""... It\'s a subjective idea at all! Therefore, the Animal Protection Law should be abolished. Besides, animals should not have the same rights as humans. The whole law is simply spoiling pets and animals from a subjective point of view, and this law does not help human society at all!', 'Adopt stray animals, subsidize neutering and a free animal health check_Background Reasons Taiwan\'s ""Zero Euthanasia for Stray Animals"" policy came into effect on February 4, 2017, and officially hit the road on February 6. Since then, all public animal shelters in Taiwan have banned the culling of dogs and cats. Although it is regarded as a major progress in Taiwan\'s animal protection movement, the adoption of such a policy lacks corresponding supporting measures, and may even bring greater harm and impact to animals. Because of zero euthanasia, people feel at ease in abandoning and raising animals, and no longer worry about whether they will be punished by God for doing so, so the number of stray animals will increase even more than before. Therefore, in order to reduce the density of animals in the shelters, the local government adopted the principle of ""precise capture"", that is, stray dogs can only be captured unless they have attacked or injured the facts and have been confirmed by the informant. The excessive reproduction of stray animals, coupled with the overcrowding of animal shelters, the accumulation of too many stray animals, the environment is dirty and unsightly, and the animals live in an uncomfortable way, which easily leads to the occurrence and infection of diseases. Proposal content After adopting a stray animal in a public shelter, the identity of the stray animal will be marked on the microchip of the pet. Pets with stray animal status, after being confirmed, can be neutered free of charge at the animal hospital, and have the opportunity to have a free animal health examination. Anyone who abandons the adopted animals at will will be verified based on the microchip and the pet owner will be fined.', 'Cats and dogs across the country (including commercially bred and traded dogs and cats, stray dogs and cats, pet dogs and cats, and imported dogs and cats) are all subject to pet registration, and owners found to be violating regulations will be punished without persuasion._1. At present, not all counties and cities implement TNVR for stray cats and dogs. The TNVR for external stray cats and dogs should be enforced across Taiwan to reduce the proliferation of external stray cats and dogs. Incorporating TNVR into policies and decrees can be implemented more quickly. However, all stray dogs and cats are registered as pets, which can force local governments to manage stray dogs and cats, control the population, and speed up the TNVR sterilization work. 2. The current regulations only require microchip implantation for commercial dogs and cats in breeding farms and trading businesses. Chips are only numbers and do not represent identity marking, and source management cannot be implemented. Commercial cats and dogs in breeding farms and trading businesses should be forced to register pets from birth (the concept of household registration), so that local government animal protection agencies can actually control the source, implement management of breeding farms and trading businesses, completely eradicate legal protection and illegality, and handle change registration according to the flow (traceable concept). 3. For cats and dogs imported from abroad, although microchips and rabies vaccinations have been mandatory, domestic laws clearly stipulate that dogs and cats should be registered and sterilized as pets. Once they enter the country, they must comply with domestic laws. The customs will have veterinary quarantine officers who should complete the pet registration and neutering of dogs and cats after entering the country (the importer or owner should pay the fee to the customs) before they are released for the owner to take back for effective control. 4. Amendment to Article 22 of the Animal Protection Law does not stipulate that the owner is not required to use birth control. As long as the owner is a dog, cats and dogs should be fertilized to prevent private births. 5. The law stipulates that commercial dogs and cats are inspected only once a year. There are no inspection regulations for pet dogs and cats, and source management cannot be implemented. The Council of Agriculture should announce the number of dogs and cats in counties and cities across the country every year, and use special laws that go beyond local system laws to control personnel. One animal protection inspector is assigned to every 1,000 dogs and cats. Cats should be treated once a year. After the management is implemented, the number of animal protection workers will be reduced year by year. 7. To improve the environment of public and private shelters, set standards (including medical equipment) and staffing of administration, management, and veterinary staff according to legal regulations. In addition, large-scale enterprises are encouraged to set up public welfare private animal shelters in the form of tax reduction and exemption, so as to improve the quality of shelter and the plight of insufficient resources in existing private shelters. 8. Pet registration should be linked with household registration management. When the owner’s household registration changes, pet registration should be changed simultaneously, and household registration management should note the registration information of household dogs, cats and pets. Although the current pet registration is mandatory, there are still provisions for persuasion and improvement. The persuasion should be cancelled. If a dog or cat that has not been registered is found, the owner can be directly punished, and the current minimum fine of 3,000 yuan and a maximum of 15,000 yuan will be raised to a minimum of 15,000 yuan and a maximum fine of 75,000 yuan.']"

If you think, I’ll just buy a second-hand house. In fact, housing investors have their sights on the second-hand house market. It’s also the time when banks start low-interest loans. You can’t buy second-hand houses as you want, and they are often bought by investors. They rent out a second child and let others pay the loan for themselves. However, new construction companies often use verbal words to convince you that there are not many houses left as soon as the sale starts, in order to speculate on housing prices, but in fact there are a lot of empty houses. The above is just a dictation. In fact, the current policies: such as real estate transaction registration, vacant house tax, house hoarding tax, and increasing the tax rate for purchasing multiple houses, are all advocated. It is suggested to curb the vacancy rate and the endless price rise in the legislative stage. 1. Taxation: For ""real estate tax"", ""transaction tax"", ""spread tax"" (sales and transactions price difference), ""rent personal income tax"", four parts are listed, formulated by the central government, and the tax collected is distributed to local governments. B. For the sale of new houses, builders are required to honestly disclose the selling price, make the transaction transparent, reduce sales disputes, and achieve the principle of fairness and justice in the transaction. C. The seller must be forced to enter the actual price of the house price transaction in order to obtain the authorization letter to protect the buyer\'s right to purchase the house. D. The reasonable price of the new house should be proposed by the builder based on the three aspects of land cost, building material cost, and labor cost. 3. Penal measures: A. When the house price exceeds 50% of the applied reasonable price, the penalty should be xxx and the person in charge of the seller should face a prison term without a fine. B. Those who cannot afford to buy a house will be fined and imprisoned without a fine, and those who log in to buy a house with their heads will be given a heavier sentence. .................................................. The above refers to the housing policies of Germany and Singapore.................................................................................', 'Stabilize housing prices, home ownership, so that housing is no longer a tool for speculation~_The spirit of the proposal: 1. Implement the spirit of returning prices to the public, fairness, and housing justice. 2. High-frequency transactions of short-term housing transactions, renting houses, increasing the tax rate, earmarking funds for special purposes, expanding investment in social housing construction, subsidizing the weak and maintenance. 3. Disconnect the rent of social housing from the market price, lease according to the standard and spirit of the announced land price, rather than the market price, and levy land value tax for investors/speculators, and tax based on the announced land price, especially for the disadvantaged and ordinary people. 4. Under the guise of returning to the market mechanism, investors are allowed to speculate, causing people to be unable to rent houses, and housing prices have risen to the point that people cannot afford them. This is the government\'s inaction and dereliction of duty. Residential justice is the responsibility of the government, not procrastination and grace. 5. Stop deceiving yourself by saying that real estate is a locomotive industry. There is not a single advanced country in the world that has developed through real estate speculation by the whole people. China\'s lessons and lessons learned from the past are right in front of us. 6. The construction of government public works is the construction invested by the people\'s tax money, and the results of regional development driven by it should be shared by the whole people, not as a tool for consortium builders to hype. Proposal content: 1. For the same natural person, their spouse, and minor children, who hold more than 2 ""self-use houses"" at the same time, and the holding period of the third or more households (including the third household) is within the following range, when considering the purchase, there will be renovation and related fees, so 100% taxation will not be imposed. Note 1: The house changer should not be considered, the house should not be held as an investment commodity, and the house change should not be used as an arbitrage. If the house changer is really self-occupied, he will not have the psychology of speculative arbitrage and expect to profit from it. Note 2: Purchases by non-natural persons should still be handled in the same way. Those who sell within 1-5 years are subject to 80% difference tax. Those who sell within 6-10 years are subject to 50% difference tax. Those who sell within 10-20 years are subject to 25% difference tax. Price tax must be registered and taxed at the real price at the time of purchase and sale. It is no longer levied at the announced land price, and the more households there are, the higher the tax rate, and the progressive tax rate is adopted. Note: The purchase by non-natural persons still needs to be handled by reference. If it is used as an internal staff dormitory, a certificate needs to be provided. If it violates the rules, it needs to be paid and fined. 3. If the same natural person, his/her spouse, and minor children hold more than 2 ""self-use residences"" at the same time, after the second household, banks are not allowed to undertake house purchase loans, and can only lend with credit loans. For each additional household, the loan interest rate adopts a progressive tax rate. 4. Restrict investment institutions, finance, and insurance companies from purchasing ""houses for self-use"" for investment purposes. 5. The above-mentioned income should be invested in the construction of social housing. At the same time, it should not be based on ""comparing with the rental market in the vicinity"", which will cause the rent of social housing to be unaffordable even for the weak. 6. Increase the scale of social housing, reduce the rent of social housing year by year in the future, and reduce the incentives and motivations for self-purchasing houses. At the same time, the unreasonable regulations that the rent of social housing will be increased year by year and the rent must be moved out after the expiration of the period will be cancelled.', ""Levy land hoard house tax to achieve average land rights_Purpose: The general direction is to control land prices. Individuals or legal persons should be controlled to hold a large number of land houses (houses basically include land), and hoard them to wait for the rise. Method: It is necessary to adjust the holding tax (land value tax, housing tax). It is better to sell than to collect rent or to increase the population share. Amendments: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on Equal Land Rights, local tax rates remain unchanged for self-occupiers, and multiplied for non-self-occupiers to bridge the gap between market prices and announced land prices. Additions: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on the Equalization of Land Titles, National Tax Collection, and tax bases will accumulate the total amount of tax bases reported by each locality, and set grades, thereby controlling the amount of land holdings. Personal concept formula: the owner's total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Conceptual formula of legal person: the owner’s total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Items that can be deducted (turnover, business tax, employee salaries, etc.) depend on how much tax this piece of land helps the government generate, or how many families it takes care of; then the individual case provides upstream and downstream relationships for review. Explanation: Is the country's construction land really not enough? The reason for the imbalance between the supply and demand of landed houses is that the cost of holding landed houses is very low. We all know that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone knows that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone thinks that they can only buy and not sell. 1. Don’t plan for light holding tax of 3% and 5%. Of course, light tax is like boiling a frog in warm water. What I want is 5 times and 10 times the tax amount to bridge the gap between the market price and the announced land price. 2. Definition of house hoarding: The owner of the house has not registered, even if the house is vacant, it is also hoarding the house, and the unoccupied house tax must be paid. Charitable rental is an evil law set up to make these people hoard houses. One day it will not be a charity, so it is not called hoarding during this period? It is better for the government to impose heavy taxes to subsidize renters. Significantly increase the tax on non-self-occupied houses, and levy national taxes to subsidize disadvantaged renters according to the national overall progressive method. 3. Definition of hoarding land: Regardless of whether it is rezoning or buying and inheriting vacant land for construction, regardless of whether there are roads or parking lots and gas stations, etc., it cannot be used as land tax. As long as it is land for construction, it must pay land value tax. Setting up a parking lot seems to be very public welfare. When it turns back to the construction site one day, isn’t it called land hoarding during this period? Why not build a city plan to reward three-dimensional parking towers, or set up public parking lots when the land is rezoned. Substantially increase the land price tax for non-owner-occupied people, and levy national taxes to supplement military expenditures to defend the country in accordance with the overall progressive method throughout the country. 4. Returning prices to the public: The government takes care of the landlords in every possible way. Land rezoning changes, agricultural land has been converted into industrial land. Landlords don’t even think about how long they have broken the law. 5. Legal use: Industrial land is used to build houses, agricultural land is used to build factories, illegal use of land should be reported immediately and demolished, including industrial houses where collective housing has become a company share, air-raid shelter compartment rental, etc. are illegal. 6. The problem of land lease: The land should be used to build houses for people to live in, instead of using iron sheets to collect rent and continue hoarding the land. It is obviously residential land but it does not help housing at all. Land cannot be imported, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. 7. The problem of house rental: I live in a relatively small house and have enough room to rent others to collect rent. I shouldn’t buy more and more land and continue to collect rent. Do these people look at the rent of 2% or 3% in that year? Of course they look at the increase of 20% to 30% in the year. 8. Fish and meat rent collection: A large number of rent collectors who hold land and housing are equivalent to fish and meat villagers. Rent collection cannot create employment. 9. Reasonable rent collection: For example, the government plans to pay 30 per person, but I only use 20, or I only use 10 when I am wronged, and I have no objection to using the rest for rent collection. 10. Reasonable rent: the monthly rent for residential needs, it is stipulated that the total rental income of the leased object shall not be greater than the leased object (current value of the announced land + assessed current value of the house)/360; 360 months are calculated based on the building’s use for 30 years. 11. The government is required to set a date for the sunrise of land hoarding tax as soon as possible, so that financial real estate and other related industries can start to respond.""]"

The calculation method of compensatory leave for overtime work should be handled in the same way as the calculation method of doubling overtime pay, such as multiplying by 1.33/1.66/2 times instead of 1:1 conversion. 2. The employer cannot limit the time limit for compensatory leave, otherwise the wages for extended working hours shall be arrested according to law. [Explanation] According to Article 24 of the current Labor Standards Law, only those employers who regulate the extension of labor hours, the wages for the extension of working hours shall be paid according to the standard (listed below). However, in order to save costs, employers often require workers to exchange compensatory leave instead of overtime pay, and even compensatory leave can only be exchanged at a rate of 1:1 (overtime work on holidays can only be exchanged for one day of compensatory leave on weekdays), which is completely unfair to workers. In addition, most employers will limit the use period of labor compensatory leave: for example, it must be used up within two months. Workers ""eat"" compensatory leave before they have used it up, and are not paid overtime pay in accordance with the law. However, in practice, if they want to ask for compensatory leave, they may be made things difficult by various factors or threatened with performance appraisals. The above-mentioned phenomenon has led to the laborers working hard overtime, but in the end they have nothing. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor should face up to this problem. I urge you to start amending the law as soon as possible, just like the amendment of a case, requiring that even if the labor and management agree to use compensatory leave in exchange for compensation for extended working hours, it should be handled in accordance with Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act and the multiplier calculation standard of related laws and regulations. For example: if you work overtime on holidays, the overtime pay is double, so the compensatory leave should be two days. (Currently only one day) Two hours before overtime work on weekdays, the catch repair should be multiplied by 1.33 to calculate, and from the third hour onwards, multiplied by 1.66 to calculate. Guo Fangyu, the former Minister of Labor, also said in the Legislative Yuan that it is unfair to replace overtime pay with compensatory leave and will review it in the near future. However, with the change of ministers, there is no change in overtime pay in proportion to compensatory leave. Please ask the Ministry of Labor to face up to this problem. Workers cannot be allowed to do meritorious deeds forever, but their hard work will not be worth compensatory rest. [Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act] 1. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than one-third of their daily hourly wages. 2. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than two-thirds of their daily hourly wages. 3. In accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 3, those who extend their working hours shall be paid double the daily hourly wages. If the employer makes the laborer work on the day of rest stipulated in Article 36, and the working time is less than two hours, the wage shall be paid an additional one and one-third of the normal hourly wage; if the worker continues to work after working for two hours, an additional one and two-thirds of the normal hourly wage shall be paid. For the calculation of the working hours and wages of the rest day mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if it is less than four hours, it shall be counted as four hours; if it exceeds four hours to less than eight hours, it shall be counted as eight hours; if it exceeds eight hours to less than twelve hours, it shall be counted as twelve hours.', 'The truth about 2 days off a week (one day off in one case), the legal exploitation of low-priced labor holidays_I think the questions in the chart above are like elementary school math problems, and anyone can easily know the answer: Aarau needs to pay a minimum of 217 yuan for overtime to be reasonable. And it will not be worthwhile if the employer pays more than 257 yuan. In order to achieve the goal of ""quantity with price"", the employer must pay at least 257 yuan, so as to reduce the total working hours and reduce overwork. The sad thing is that the officials of the Ministry of Labor, as if they have not received compulsory education, have formulated an overtime pay of 238 yuan for rest days, saying that they will ""measure the amount with price"", and leave the more bloody 200 yuan for overtime work on weekdays, and continue to sell labor to enterprises at a low price. The current overtime pay system is very unreasonable and is exploiting laborers who work hard for their families and livelihoods. The following examples will illustrate why it is unreasonable: Take a worker with a monthly salary of 36,000 yuan as an example: the current overtime pay is based on 240 hours to calculate the hourly salary of the worker, but the overtime pay rate is only one-third of the first two hours per hour. The worker works 1 hour of overtime on Monday (ordinary day), so the overtime pay for this hour is (36000/240)*(4/3) = 150*(4/3) = 200 yuan. However, according to the press release of the Ministry of Labor, the legal working hours of laborers are 1992 hours per year (the controversial 7-day national holiday is deleted), which means that the average monthly legal working hours are 166 hours. This means that monthly wage workers can get a full salary of 36,000 yuan if they work 166 hours a month, that is, they can get 217 yuan for every hour they actually work. Calculated based on the legal working hours, the hourly wage of workers is 217 yuan, but the overtime pay for workers guaranteed by the government is only 200 yuan. This is not only to avoid labor overwork by price and quantity, but also to sell labor at a low price and exploit labor for profit. It is completely robbing the poor and helping the rich. Based on the average annual working hours of 2,134.8 hours in 2013, the average monthly overtime hours of workers is about 11.8 hours, and this kind of labor exploitation has continued for more than 16 years, which means that each worker who has worked hard for 16 years has lost more than 38,000 yuan. And how much the employer actually pays: the laborer with a monthly salary of 36,000 is the employer\'s cost after adding labor insurance, retirement, and health insurance. A monthly salary of 36,000 yuan is the 15th insurance level. The employer will pay 2,591 yuan for labor insurance, 2,178 yuan for labor retirement, and 1,645 yuan for health insurance. Therefore, the employer needs to pay a total of 42,414 per month to get the labor of 166 hours per month, which is 255.5 yuan per hour of labor. Based on the average annual working hours of 2,134.8 hours in 103 years, the average monthly overtime hours of workers is about 11.8 hours. This kind of labor exploitation has continued for more than 16 years. This means that the government has helped employers to legally exploit labor and saved more than 1 trillion, and is accumulating their hard-earned money at a rate of 6 billion every month. Labor income: A worker with a monthly salary of 36,000 based on legal working hours earns 217 yuan per hour, but the government-guaranteed worker’s overtime pay is only 200 yuan. Isn’t this a legal exploitation and cheap labor? Employers pay: a monthly salary of 36,000 workers, plus labor insurance, labor retirement, and health insurance, the employer must pay at least 255 yuan per hour during normal working hours, but the government-guaranteed worker’s overtime pay is only 200 yuan. From the wages during normal working hours, the workers actually get 217 yuan, or the employer has to pay 255 yuan, it can be seen that the 200 yuan overtime paid by the government is exploiting workers and selling labor at a low price. When working overtime, workers can only get a minimum of 92% of the legal working hours, while employers only need to pay 78% of the usual hourly hours. Obviously, the government\'s policy has created overwork and fed sweat-based businesses! This long-standing system that has harmed the reasonable rights and interests of workers needs to be changed, and the actual labor paid (166 hours of legal monthly working hours) must be used as the benchmark for calculating overtime pay. Therefore, it is advocated to increase the rate of overtime pay and amend Article 24 of the current Labor Standards Act to increase it to 1.93 times the wage per hour within two hours of extended working hours (1 and 1/3 times the 217 yuan in the above example). In the two extended hours, the wage is 2.41 times per hour (1 and 2/3 times of 217 yuan in the above example). In the draft of a case of one rest (weekly 2 days), the addition of more than 1 and 1/3 and the addition of more than 1 and 2/3 should be changed to more than 2.93 times and more than 3.41 times at the same time. Taking the above-mentioned monthly salary of 36,000 yuan as an example: on weekdays, the extended working hours are 290 yuan per hour for the first 2 hours, 362 yuan per hour for the next 2 hours, 290 yuan per hour for the 2 hours before the holiday, and 362 yuan per hour for the overtime 2 hours. That is to say, no matter what, it cannot be lower than 257 yuan, otherwise, how can we use ""price to control quantity"" to avoid overwork?', 'The government should not take the lead in exploiting labor, civil servants should be paid overtime pay according to the actual number of approved overtime hours, abolish compensatory leave and administrative reward system_Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act stipulates that if an employer extends the working hours of a worker, overtime pay shall be paid at the rate of one-third to one-and-two-thirds of the normal hourly wage. The government, as the employer of public sector workers (civil servants and state-owned enterprises), not only does not pay overtime pay, but even overtime hours exceeding 20 hours can only be given administrative rewards such as compensatory leave or rewards. Junior-level supervisors adopt a responsibility system and are not allowed to receive any overtime pay. They can only choose compensatory leave or rewards. Therefore, it is suggested that the government should strictly control the overtime work of civil servants in advance, and pay overtime pay according to the actual hours for the overtime work approved and assigned, and stop taking the lead in exploiting labor. Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act. If the employer extends the working hours of the laborer, the wages for the extended working hours shall be increased according to the following standards: 1. If the extended working hours are less than two hours, an additional one-third of the normal hourly wages shall be paid. 2. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than two-thirds of their daily hourly wages. 3. In accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 3, those who extend their working hours shall be paid double the daily hourly wages. If the employer makes the laborer work on the day of rest stipulated in Article 36, and the working time is less than two hours, the wage shall be paid an additional one and one-third of the normal hourly wage; if the worker continues to work after working for two hours, an additional one and two-thirds of the normal hourly wage shall be paid. For the calculation of the working hours and wages of the rest day mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if it is less than four hours, it shall be counted as four hours; if it exceeds four hours to less than eight hours, it shall be counted as eight hours; if it exceeds eight hours to less than twelve hours, it shall be counted as twelve hours. Main points of overtime payment for each agency (abbreviated) 2. Payment standard: Calculated in the following way per hour: (1) Employees: non-supervisors are paid monthly salaries and professional bonuses. Supervisors and junior (assigned) non-supervisors are paid according to their supervisory positions. For those who have a record, plus supervisory positions or the sum of the three items of supervisory compensation. Divided by 240 is the hourly payment standard. 3. Employees of various agencies who have been assigned to work overtime in accordance with regulations may encourage employees to choose to take make-up leave within six months after working overtime, and the unit is hourly, without additional overtime pay. 5. Overtime control regulations for staff of various agencies (including hired personnel by contract): (1) Overtime work by staff of various agencies (including hired personnel by contract) shall be assigned by the supervisor of the unit after verification and assignment according to business needs. Each person shall work overtime no more than four hours per day and twenty hours per month. (3) Overtime work shall not be paid to those who work overtime except for the various personnel listed in the proviso of the preceding paragraph, but may choose supplementary leave or rewards according to the fact of overtime work and regulations.']"

The basic spirit of representative elections is: selection of talents and abilities. But in recent years, voters can only be forced to choose one they can accept from a pile of rotten apples. As a result, voters can only vote for ""bad candidates"". By ""disagreeing with the above candidates"": 1. Allow voters to express their disagreement with the candidates. 2. If the number of votes is lower than that of candidates who disagree, they will not be elected and will be banned from participating in any public office elections for 5 years, which is the cooling-off period for elections.

Does the longer the election period, the more beneficial it is for ""those with huge funds and resources""? 2. The larger the investment, the easier it is for the funder to manipulate it behind the scenes, resulting in the problem of benefit transmission after the election? 3. Is ""support poll"" one of the root causes of election bribery, underground gambling, malicious attacks, abandonment of insurance, and manipulation of candidates by funders? 4. Is it easy to be taken out of context and distorted by promoting policies and ideas when running for election? 5. ""Candidate\'s character"", during the election period, is it difficult to judge right from wrong, and it is mostly smeared? -------------------------------------- 4 methods 1. ""Adopt two-stage voting"" 2. ""Shorten the election time"" (from registration to voting) 3. ""Polls only focus on issues, not candidates"" 4. ""Each political party can propose multiple candidates, and then combine votes"" (also applicable to non-party membership) ---------------------------------------------- The details are as follows Method 1: Adopt two-stage voting The first stage: first decide whether the ""incumbent"" can continue in office? (Yes or No) (If not, one month later, Proceed to the second stage) The second stage: elect the ""next"" to prevent the ""current"" from being unable to lose and accuse the opponent of voting. Avoiding the hostile relationship between ""current"" and ""candidates"" is conducive to subsequent handovers and allows new appointments to get started quickly. Avoid the ""incumbent"" holding on to the ruling resources and ""candidates"" duel, resulting in unfair competition. Organizations or media can investigate the satisfaction of the ""incumbent"" in ""normal times"", so that the public can discuss the results of governance at any time. Compete with yourself, not with others. ""Incumbents"" can focus on their own governance and reduce the time, energy and money consumption of competing with others. -------------------------------------------- Method 2: Shorten the election time (from registration to voting) •In an age of illiteracy and lack of information, candidates have to give speeches everywhere, which requires a long election time. •In an era of less illiteracy and the age of smart phones, candidates\' political opinions can be seen and heard in a short period of time. •Those who intend to stand for election can ""normally"" publicize their views and ideas on public policy to the public instead of publicizing after registration. • For ""social issues"" that need to be understood by the public, we should find ways to let the public know about them in normal times. (Arguing after the election is easy to be distorted, and often only ""issues that are easy to be manipulated"" are left) --------------------------------------------- Method 3: Polls only target issues, not candidates The reasons are as follows • ""Candidates"" will ""attack"" candidates with ""highest or close"" poll results • ""Candidate support"" will become the basis for election bribery and underground gambling (which constituency, how far behind, and how many people will be bribed) Question: What does ""support poll"" mean? (In the previous era, elections cost a lot of money, and donors and candidates conducted polls in order to know their chances of winning) (In the future era, for the public interest, to achieve fair elections, can the law be amended to restrict support polls?) -------------------------------------------------- Method 4: Each political party (including non-party affiliation) can launch multiple candidates. The more candidates there are, the more one-on-one duels can be avoided and social polarization can be avoided. The more candidates there are, the less control the donors have on the candidates. Avoid internal fighting, which is a great loss to any organization. It can truly reflect the number of votes won by the candidates, avoid the abandonment effect, and avoid the watermelon clinging to the big side. --------------------------------------------- Specific implementation method A ""gamified electronic voting method"" (the following is an example) 1. Electronic registration (day 1~4) Anyone who is willing to participate in the election can register as a ""candidate"". Method 1: The platform assists in fundraising for 3 days, those who meet the standard pay the fee, those who fail to reach the standard refund, and complete the registration (3rd day). Method 2: The candidates pay the fee themselves and complete the registration (4th day) 2. Publish the ""list of candidates & political views"" and let the ""candidates"" debate their ""political views"" online or record them into a video. The public can upload ""all kinds of creative and funny stickers, and short videos"" through the ""real name system"" to support or oppose a candidate. (Real-name uploading is used to avoid malicious slander and rumors from some people) (People can choose whether to see multiple stickers and short videos when voting) (Day 5~6) 3. Electronic voting (Day 7) Use a ""facemash-like"" method to conduct one-to-one comparisons to attract people\'s full and in-depth participation. Next to the candidate\'s name, list the main political views. (Click more, you can watch short videos made by candidates for 3~5 minutes, or you don’t need to click.) (Click more, you can see various stickers and short videos, or you don’t need to click.) When the voting time is over, the system will announce the voting results immediately. (Billing) 4. The system automatically merges the ""number of votes of a certain political party candidate"" into the ""highest vote-getter of this political party"". The system automatically merges the ""number of votes for candidates without party affiliation"" into the ""highest vote-getter without party affiliation"". (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the combined votes are not combined to the highest voters, but are evenly distributed to the top 3 highest voters) 5. The system announces the ""highest vote winner"" as the elected candidate. (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the system will announce the ""top 3 high voters"" as the winners.)']"

The government keeps saying that we want a non-nuclear homeland and that nuclear energy should be replaced by green energy. However, various alternatives are either too late (the evaluation of various power generation methods takes time), or they are expensive (solar power generation equipment is expensive and have a short service life), or they are unrealistic (tidal power generation, ocean current power generation, or use love to generate electricity?), or they are serious pollution (coal-fired thermal power generation is the fastest way to make up for the current power shortage, but the whole world, including mainland China, is working hard to reduce this highly polluting power generation method. Taiwan has turned back and set Taiwan’s environmental protection back for 30 years, why don’t we simply burn wood to generate electricity?) Seeing that the peak of electricity consumption in summer is approaching, there is still no better way to solve the urgent need. The promise of abolishing the fourth nuclear power plant and establishing a non-nuclear homeland seems to remain unchanged, but the price is to restart the second nuclear power plant and restart the high-pollution coal-fired thermal power plant that has been shut down for more than 10 years. But isn't Nuclear Two nuclear energy? Is Core 2 any cleaner? Is nuclear 2 safer than nuclear 4? Is Core 2 newer than Core 4? Will restarting Core 2 be cheaper than launching a new Core 4? Please ask the government to think of some reasons that can convince the people of the country, and tell the people why the nuclear plant that spent 300 to 400 billion people's hard-earned money to build is not used. Instead of abolishing it, it restarts the old nuclear plant that has been in operation for 3 to 40 years. What is the reason for this? Even if it is impossible to abolish the nuclear power for a while, if it is necessary to use it as an emergency, it should be used to activate the new one and destroy the old one, right? This matter is like an old car that has been driven for 3 to 40 years and is about to rot, and insists on repairing it regardless of the cost, but it is as ridiculous as sending a new car that has not been driven for a day to the scrap yard to sell it as scrap iron!"", 'Start nuclear power, reduce thermal power generation, and reduce carbon emissions_Start the nuclear power plant and solve the blackout crisis. And use the surplus of nuclear power generation to develop green energy. Raise the reserve capacity. Nuclear energy decision-making returns to professionalism. The operation review of nuclear power plants is changed from political figures such as legislators who do not have nuclear energy and electric power-related scientific literacy to personnel with professional nuclear energy knowledge. (such as the National Energy Association, nuclear engineering professors and scholars) In addition, the quality control of the site and building of nuclear power plants should be done well, and the safety standards of foreign nuclear power plants should be referred to, and manufacturers and supervisory agencies who want to cut corners and materials should be punished', 'The counties and cities with the most votes for restarting the nuclear program should give priority to planning and building green cities with nuclear waste!_In response to the restart of Nuclear Power Plant 4, most of the focus is on whether the electricity is sufficient. Because Taiwanese people are accustomed to the consumption habit of ""eating as much as they want"", it is difficult to learn from countries that are also located in the earthquake zone, consider dismantling nuclear power to save electricity, or develop green energy. In addition, many people pay attention to the air pollution problem caused by thermal power generation. Is it decided based on public opinion that the counties and cities with the most votes for nuclear four-way restart should be prioritized for nuclear power generation-related waste disposal? Provide preferential benefits for electricity charges or related tax relief, etc., to create green counties and cities for nuclear waste? Set up a nuclear waste greening park and museum to introduce the development of nuclear energy to nuclear waste treatment, and then focus on nuclear waste greening for sightseeing, and also let the public understand the knowledge of nuclear power generation. Emphasize again that nuclear power generation is not bad. In response to economic development and electricity consumption for people’s livelihood, it is difficult for the government to implement energy-saving requirements for industrial electricity consumption, and it is also impossible to increase the amount of carbon emission tax. It is only due to the user payment mechanism. Just like previous news reports that residents do not want to be affected by electromagnetic waves, and thus opposed the construction of base stations, but later proposed that they would be willing to build base stations because it would affect the use of the Internet. If you want to use nuclear power to generate electricity, you have to accept the possible risks of nuclear power generation.']"

Among them, the rate of ""girls"" using e-cigarettes is even higher than that of men. In 2019, there were more than 200 cases of e-cigarettes on campus, and as of March this year, it reached 86 cases. Even elementary schools have been seized.

There are currently 20.8 million people in Taiwan who are affected by second-hand and third-hand smoke in residential areas. Instead of doing nothing on purpose', 'Held a public hearing on the revision of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes (smoke-free substitutes)_The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that one billion people will die from cigarettes in this century. Cigarettes kill more than 7 million people every year, of which more than 6 million people are due to direct use of cigarettes, and about 890,000 people are non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Overall, one person dies from smoking in less than 5 seconds. According to statistics from the National Health Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, about 27,000 people die from smoking in Taiwan every year, and one person dies from smoking every 20 minutes. Concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction and Prevention Proper taxation and regulation can help reduce health harm There are more than 7,000 chemical substances in cigarette smoke, of which 93 are carcinogenic and harmful substances, and 15 of them are listed as ""Class I carcinogens"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Experts from the Taiwan Tobacco Harm Reduction Initiative, the only one in the world that has obtained the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) smokeless tobacco certificate, said that smoking is harmful to health. If you can stop smoking, you should stop smoking. If you are smoking, the best way for your health is to quit smoking. However, for the large number of smokers who are unable to quit smoking or do not want to quit smoking, if the government can properly tax and regulate smoke-free substitutes, it will undoubtedly reduce the health damage caused by cigarettes to smokers, and at the same time greatly reduce the negative impact of second-hand smoke and cigarette butts on non-smokers and the environment. E-cigarettes, heating tobacco iQOS Reasonable regulation is the key. The 2020 World Health Organization European Branch e-cigarette report clearly pointed out that the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Engineering and the School of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control have all recognized the potential of e-cigarettes to improve public health. The WHO also emphasized that the government\'s reasonable regulation of e-cigarettes is the key. The goal is to minimize the consequences of the tobacco epidemic and continue to bring positive effects to public health. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent non-smokers, especially young people, from being exposed to nicotine, and fully consider the interests of smokers to find a balance in regulation. The US FDA allows the sale of heated cigarettes. Data show that it can reduce the risk of exposure to harmful substances. The US FDA approved the application for the sale of heated tobacco iQOS in the US in 2019. The US FDA stated that the data submitted by the industry shows that the use of licensed information to sell these specific products will help addicted adult smokers get rid of traditional combustion cigarettes and reduce smokers’ exposure to harmful chemicals on the premise that smokers completely switch to use. In addition, the U.S. FDA also agrees that the heated tobacco iQOS can be sold in the local market as a ""risk-modified tobacco product"" and can be labeled with promotional slogans such as ""reduce consumers\' exposure to harmful chemicals in cigarettes"".', 'Set up smoking rooms widely, and encourage people to smoke in the smoking rooms, so that non-smoking people can have clean air._Although Taiwan is currently committed to tobacco hazard control, the results are somewhat insufficient. Some people advocate a total ban on smoking, but we believe that if it is adopted, smokers will have nowhere to buy cigarettes, which will make the underground black market more serious, and even create a monopoly phenomenon in illegal tobacco factories, and will also cause strong opposition from smokers; and if the tobacco tax is raised, it will also have the opposite effect. Therefore, this case is put forward as a suggestion for tobacco hazard prevention and control policy: 1. Widely set up smoking rooms, smoking areas and ashtrays on the roads and public places: Cigarette butts are common on the streets of Taiwan because smoking can be done everywhere in Taiwan, and cigarette butts can be thrown everywhere on the streets. Therefore, smoking rooms should be widely set up in public places and on the roads, so that smokers do not have to go all the way to a specific smoking room to smoke. With this convenient measure for smokers, not only can the number of people smoking on the streets be greatly reduced, but also the citizens can have clean air. In addition, ashtrays should also be set up on the road to prevent smokers from throwing cigarette butts in the flowers and ditch beside the road, so as to beautify the city appearance. 2. Increase the penalties for smoking in non-smoking places, and strictly prohibit littering of cigarette butts, and encourage the public to report: Although there are regulations that prohibit smoking near schools and specific places, our observations show that there are not many people who violate the law, and many people even throw away cigarette butts after smoking. We believe that increasing penalties and strengthening crackdowns are the last line of defense for the public to self-discipline; and we encourage the public to report anonymously so that offenders cannot escape the law. 3. Strengthen publicity on tobacco hazard prevention among young children: It would be too late if tobacco hazard prevention and control were taught in the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school. At present, there are still many people in elementary and high schools who will illegally buy tobacco products, and the promotion at this time will not have much impact on them. I think that if the publicity is carried out from the first and second grades of elementary school or even kindergarten, the children can know the harm of smoking from an early age. In addition to kindergarten, family education is also a very important part. If both can be combined, it should play a great role in the prevention and control of smoking hazards. 4. Strengthen the ban on underage smokers and merchants that sell tobacco products to minors: Even though the regulations have clearly regulated related laws such as the Tobacco Hazards Law, there are still many merchants (grocery stores) who illegally sell tobacco products to minors for profit. The ban or prohibition of selling tobacco products in grocery stores should be strengthened. 5. Improve the design of the smoking room: an effective smoking room should not make the inside a gas chamber, and the design of the intake and exhaust ports can solve the problem and avoid the second-hand smoke inside from causing trouble to non-smokers. Studies have shown that the leakage of second-hand smoke can be as high as 60% when people enter and exit the smoking room. However, if the traditional sliding door is replaced by a parallel sliding automatic door, the leakage rate of the smoke flow to the non-smoking area can be reduced by about 77%. There are many other methods that are simple and easy to implement.']"

However, I think that doing so may not be able to completely and effectively combat false information. The reasons are as follows: 1. If the enemy country’s cyber army cooperates with on-the-ground coordinators, they will use the loopholes in the management of social platforms to infiltrate groups and boards on major social platforms. Participate in community activities to win people's hearts, maliciously report specific groups and accounts, and participate in the management mechanism of social platforms to delete specific person or group accounts, allow false information (false information and hate information) to spread, and cooperate with the manipulation of online public opinion. What countermeasures do platform operators have for these problems? Can self-regulation solve these problems? 2. In addition to the threat of online fake news on social platforms, will online games and social network games with social chat function become another loophole if they follow the same pattern of spreading fake news on social platforms? To prevent the threat of false information on the Internet, you should consider various potential threats and comprehensively prevent and block loopholes. Therefore, I propose preventive countermeasures as a reference for strengthening management: 1. The government establishes or designates an independent agency to supervise the online platform in comparison with the radio and television media. And refer to the three laws and regulations of radio and television, establish applicable social platform operators (remarks) management regulations to ensure that social platform operators abide by self-regulatory norms. Remarks: Community platform is defined as a commercial and non-commercial network platform that has a certain number of communities, forums and communication functions, and displays text, pictures and images. 2. As above, it is recommended that the government establish a self-discipline management evaluation mechanism and related norms for social platforms. The evaluation norms can be divided into: the number of occurrences of false information (false information and hateful information) on social platforms. The number of public reports, acceptance and notification to the government. Confirmed by third-party NGOs as accepting improper reports, deletions and suspensions. Times of platform self-discipline management (defined as the number of times platform managers regularly manage, review and delete reported false information). Transparency of posting and posting users on social platforms (defined as posting and posting addresses, number of account postings and postings (and number of inappropriate postings and postings), and account usage time and average usage times, etc.). Social platform administrative management, financial and personnel structure information (provided that it complies with the Personal Information Law). The key point is that those who have low scores or poor evaluations will be assisted in counseling for improvement for the first time, and will be placed on the observation list before improvement. If any illegal situation is discovered and the harm is serious, the supervisors and management personnel of the units involved shall be held legally responsible. 3. It is recommended that online games and social network games apply laws and regulations (for example, Article 14 of items that should be recorded and should not be recorded in the stereotyped contract of online game services). 4. Civilian information security units, fact-checking organizations, and volunteers in related fields are included in the civil defense system. Assist governments in investigating and preventing threats of misinformation."", 'Suggestions on amendments to the Three Laws of Broadcasting and Television._Rationale Thank you for your proposal. At present, there is a ""proposal to prevent false information"" online, which is being seconded. In order to increase the capacity of seconding, please make more use of it. Therefore, this case will not enter the seconding. First of all: The focus of the proposal to prevent false information is to suggest that the government adopt three directions: supervising Internet platform operators to abide by self-discipline, regularly evaluating the management mechanism of Internet platforms, and preventing false information from being incorporated into the civil defense system. The main purpose of the proposal to amend the Three Laws on Broadcasting and TV is to prevent the broadcast media from reporting false or harmful news, and manipulating the volume of the media to violate news ethics. How does this relate to preventing false information on the Internet? Second: Discuss the article that other proposers are not approved: https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/446799f1-2d2c-406d-a32b-9165721633e4 Thank you for your proposal. 1. People\'s freedom of speech is ""protected to the maximum extent"" by the Constitution, which means that if restrictions must be imposed, the ""constitutional reservation principle"" should be followed, and the ""minimum administrative interference principle"" and ""judicial reservation principle"" should be adopted for the restriction of freedom. 2. The media is a check and balance force in addition to the three powers of the executive, legislative and judicial powers. The freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and dissemination. This right cannot be undermined by unilateral interference by the executive power, that is, the content of media broadcasts cannot be restricted by administrative measures. The government cannot pre-censor the content of media reports in any form and for any reason. Therefore, the case does not enter secondment. Here I would like to ask the government: Use the name of freedom of speech to gradually harm speech and the democratic system. Is this a part of the democratic system? This is why the concept of ""defensive democracy"" is very much needed in the Republic of China and the reason for reviewing and amending the law: spreading false information and hate speech to confuse and divide the masses. Even if they report to the police, the legal system can prevent such behavior. The government should rethink whether the existing mechanism is effective? (Detailed link to the case) https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/201910160118.aspx Democracy and freedom of speech do not mean that they can be unlimited. ""The freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and dissemination. This right cannot be violated by unilateral interference of administrative power, that is, the content of media broadcasts cannot be restricted by administrative measures. The government shall not pre-censor the content of media reports in any form and for any reason. In the face of the use of broadcast media to report false information and hype the volume in an attempt to influence and confuse people\'s right to listen, the government should take action and handle it according to law, because this is definitely not part of freedom of speech and should not be covered by the scope of protection. Finally, I re-propose the content: 1.

It is good to have good intentions. But why do you still think that regulations are ahead of road signs, markings, and signs? Ordinary road users, without the guidance of specific signs, decide the speed in which to continue on the road according to the driving habits of each passer-by. For example, a vehicle turning left can pass quickly if the passer-by drives boldly. However, the current clearance measures at intersections have led to a large ambiguity about whether passers-by are breaking the law. Therefore, it depends on the subjective judgment of law enforcement officers whether it is illegal, which is not objective. Case: There is a distance between the stop line and the traffic light. Generally, the stop line is not far below the traffic light. A car turning left may wait within the stop line to wait for the oncoming car to give way or within the visual range, and pass when there is no oncoming car. However, is there really a way to complete the behavior of turning left when there is no left turn light during commuting? If the left-turning car prepares to turn left in advance, change the signal at this time to hinder the clearance of the intersection. There is also a distance between the traffic light and the stop line. The stop line is not drawn under the traffic light, but a few meters away from the traffic light. In this case, the central divider island is planted with vegetation. Who can see that there is an approaching car and wants to turn left? A left-turning car can only drive further forward and enter the intersection early to prepare to turn left. At this time, the signal is changed to hinder the clearance of the intersection. Because there are too many road signs, markings, and signs, there are problems, so I won't go into details about each situation here. Improvement requirements 1. Prevent running red lights, clear the intersections, count down to green lights at traffic lights, and let passers-by slow down early and prepare to stop. 2. The roads are equipped with long-term direction signs, and passers-by are given fair use of the road rights, and it is not necessary to rely on courage to turn left. 3. Pedestrian crossings must be equipped with pedestrian crossing signs. When pedestrians are crossing, the vehicle signs at the intersection are all red lights. No vehicles are passing through, so that pedestrians can pass safely, especially those with physical disabilities, or young children, who are not tall."", ""Pedestrians walking on crosswalks are often hit or killed by turning vehicles. In order to avoid repeated injuries, please set up all-round special signs for pedestrians!_Hello everyone: Taiwan is a small town with heavy traffic, which is well known to everyone. For a long time, Taiwan's transportation policy has been based on the rapid passage of vehicles and the resolution of traffic congestion. At the same time, many cheap methods are designed to effectively relieve traffic congestion, but invisibly endanger the safety of other passers-by. The green light allows vehicles to turn left and right, so that pedestrians must bear a high degree of risk when crossing the road at a green light through a crosswalk (commonly known as a zebra crossing). As everyone knows, large vehicles such as large trucks and buses will have a dangerous situation of inner wheel differential when turning. Regardless of whether it is a large or small vehicle, there is an A-beam design on the structure of the vehicle. These structurally necessary designs are likely to be blinded visually when the vehicle is turning. And large cars, because of the special factors such as long body and high driving position, it is often impossible to immediately detect whether there are pedestrians in front of the car and on the left and right sides at close range when the car is turning. When pedestrians walk on the crosswalk when the traffic signal is green, if the traffic signal also allows vehicles to turn left and right, the turning vehicle and the pedestrians passing through the green light often appear to cross. Coupled with the above-mentioned factors such as the blind spot of the A-beam design of the vehicle itself, the inner wheel difference caused by the turning of large vehicles, and other factors, newspapers and media have repeatedly heard the unfortunate news that pedestrians are injured or even killed by turning vehicles on crosswalks. In order to prevent such unfortunate news from happening again and again, the government should set up traffic signals exclusively for pedestrians to pass through! Let the pedestrian traffic signal and the vehicle traffic light signal be separated. When the pedestrian traffic signal light is on, the cheap measure of completely prohibiting the green light to allow the vehicle to turn left and right is to ensure the safety of pedestrians when crossing the road. At the same time, in order to facilitate pedestrian traffic and reduce the time of crossing the intersection, pedestrians should be allowed to pass in all directions during the time allowed by the pedestrian signal light. Finally, in order to avoid confusion among passers-by and increase traffic accidents, and to ensure the consistency of pedestrian crossing safety across the country, the setting of special signs and lights for pedestrian crossing should be consistent across the country and fully implemented. Some people may say that the current government is implementing a policy of comity to pedestrians. However, this policy cannot guarantee the safety of pedestrians crossing the road. The reasons are as follows: 1. Because vehicles turning left and right share the green light seconds with pedestrians crossing the road. In addition, when the red light permits the vehicle to turn left and right, the vehicle turning left and right (east-west direction) still has the danger of colliding with pedestrians (north-south direction) walking on the crosswalk. 2. Under the policy of giving priority to pedestrians, waiting for a long time for turning vehicles is likely to cause traffic jams, which will instead cause traffic congestion at intersections. Drivers of automobiles and motorcycles do not want to bear the pressure of the vehicles behind them, and often make forced turns, putting pedestrians in danger of being hit instead. 3. Taiwan's population is gradually aging, and the number of elderly people is increasing. Considering that the elderly move slowly, it takes a long time to cross the road, and the driving of automobiles and motorcycles is often not durable. 4. The law-abiding spirit of car and motorcycle drivers to yield to pedestrians is still not complete. Based on the above, in order to ensure that everyone can cross the road safely and without pressure, we urge everyone to support the proposal to urge the government to set up special signs for pedestrians crossing the road. thank you all. I wish you peace."", 'Cancel the mandatory two-stage left turn for locomotives and remove the forbidden locomotive lane.

Can Tainan City set up ""divided according to vehicle speed"" instead of ""divided by vehicle type"" and cancel ""mandatory two-stage left turn"" and delete ""no-motorcycle lanes"" so that motorcycles have a ""safe road"" and cars don\'t have to be afraid of ""flashing cars"". I believe everyone has two wheels and four wheels.

It will cut off the driving direction of the locomotive, and at the same time, it will cause traffic jams in the rear. If the locomotives in the third lane want to go straight, they have to worry about whether there will be cars in the second lane turning right directly.

When the police car and the violating vehicle were parked on the shoulder to issue a bill, they were hit from behind by a large vehicle driving in the outer lane, resulting in the death of the violator and 2 police officers on duty. Expressway roads have a special environment, which is different from ordinary county and city level roads. Stopping and reporting traffic violations on the spot poses uncertain risks to violators and police officers on duty. The National Highway Police Department should comprehensively review the current law enforcement methods and change to reporting violations after the fact. Proposals: Most of the highway traffic violation cases are speeding, illegally driving on the shoulders, not following the signs and markings (crossing trough lines, prohibiting lane changes, etc.), not keeping a safe distance, changing lanes at will, and maliciously forcing vehicles. High, it can also have a deterrent effect on offenders. According to this, although on-site stopping and reporting of traffic violations can have the effect of immediate deterrence and guidance, the speed of expressways is fast and there are many risk factors in the road environment. In order to take into account the safety of passers-by and police officers on duty, expressway traffic violation cases should be limited to after-the-fact reporting. Article 7-2 of the Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations stipulates that those who cannot or are not suitable to intercept the order and report on the spot may report directly. For example, based on the safety considerations of passers-by and on-duty police officers, it is desired to limit the majority of violations on the expressway to direct prosecution. Because law enforcement practices have strict requirements for direct prosecution (causing national highway police to stop on-site to comply with regulations), relevant road traffic regulations (penalty regulations, handling rules, executive rules, etc.) need to be comprehensively amended.', 'In response to changes in actual road conditions, the bounty system for reporting some traffic violations will be resumed_The increase in the number of public reports is due to the increase in the number of violations. It is the violators, not the informers. At the beginning of 2002, the number of traffic violations grew by almost one million a year. In addition, according to the statistics of the Police Administration, the most frequently occurring violations in 2018 were 3.76 million 112 cases of ""illegal parking"" (link 1). According to the statistics of the police inquiry website, the number of ""illegal parking"" from January to September this year was as high as 3.847 million. From the 2018 New Taipei City Top 10 Normal Traffic Violations List (Appendix 3), 2019 New Taipei City Top 10 Normal Traffic Violations List (Appendix 4), and the most illegal items reported by the public are violations Parking, 1,575,907 violations were reported in 2019, with a rate of more than 50% (link 2). It can be seen that illegal parking is indeed the most important violation of the public, and it endangers traffic safety and convenience. It has even directly or indirectly caused fatal traffic accidents (links 3 and 4). Furthermore, many major traffic accidents in recent years have been caused by drivers of automobiles and locomotives maliciously forcing vehicles (link 5) and being rude to pedestrians (links 6 and 7). Some foreign tourists were even forced to drive by gravel trucks, causing an international scandal and tarnishing our international reputation (link 8). In order to avoid police manpower shortage or laziness in performing their duties, and to provide a safer and better traffic environment for the whole people, the traffic violation reporting system should be compared with the environmental protection violation reporting system. For violations that are likely to cause traffic accidents and violate the lives and physical safety of passers-by, rewards will be issued for reporting, so as to increase the energy of the public to report and prevent accidents caused by violations from happening again. The distribution of rewards should exclude the police, because traffic violations reported by the public will still be reviewed by disinterested third-party police officers, but the police can make reports on their own. In the past, there have been cases where police officers reported improperly large amounts of rewards. Incentives exclude police officers for any reason. Therefore, this case proposes to increase the whistle-blowing rewards for violations of Article 44, Item 2, Article 48, Article 53, Item 1, Article 55, Item 1, and Article 56, Items 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations, and award 10% of the violation fine to the informant. However, in order to avoid a large number of malicious reports, additional measures can be added. The annual whistleblower bonus for the whistleblower.', 'It is recommended that the government set up ""parking watchmen"" to impose fines for illegal parking and actively check and report abandoned vehicles occupying roads._Traffic casualties in Taiwan are serious, and the country should face it squarely. Last year, the total number of traffic accidents in 2020 was 362,393, with 2,972 deaths within 30 days; this year, the total number of traffic accidents from January to September in 2021 has reached 256,188, with 2,186 deaths and 339,986 injuries within 30 days. For you, is the above the pain of countless families, or just cold numbers? 2021/12/07 The Legislative Yuan passed the third reading, amending some provisions of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Punishments"", clearly listing two categories (""dynamic violations"" and ""static violations"") and 46 items as traffic violations that the public can report. As a result of the restrictions, the most common ""red and yellow line violations"" will no longer be open to public reporting. For other detailed amendments, please refer to: https://www.moto7.net/2021/12/law-violation-report.html The traffic chaos in Taiwan is obvious to all. Originally it was the job of the police to crack down on violations, but due to the ""insufficient police force"" it was difficult to curb traffic chaos. At the end of 1996, Taiwan added Article 7-1 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Punishments"": ""For those who violate this regulation, the public may state the facts of the violation or provide evidence of the violation, and report to the highway supervisor or the police. The number of reports per year is too high for grassroots police to overwhelm. In the past, people were expected to help improve traffic because of the ""insufficient police force"", but now the public\'s right to report is limited due to the ""insufficient police force"". In the final analysis, it is Taiwan\'s lack of law enforcement capabilities! For related content such as traffic chaos in Taiwan and the history of open public reporting, please refer to: https://youtu.be/Rr_6AARhKvY If the government can effectively enforce the law, do the people still need to help themselves? Public reporting is not the ultimate goal of maintaining traffic safety, it is just a process. Taiwan\'s traffic needs to be completely improved, from road planning that conforms to traffic equality thinking (pedestrian and bicycle lanes that are as smooth as a driveway, friendly public transportation, etc.), driver\'s license system, violation point system, strengthened management of professional driving, traffic education for the public, and effective law enforcement, etc., all need to be completely abolished and retrained. Since the police manpower is insufficient, ""technical law enforcement"" and ""outsourcing"" should be considered in law enforcement. ""Static violations,"" the easiest to take down, are suggested to be dealt with by commissioners instead. Although illegal parking does not seem serious, casual Internet users can find cases of people being chased and killed by vehicles trying to avoid illegal parking on the side of the road. If even simple traffic violations cannot be effectively curbed, let alone dynamic violations that are more difficult to ban. It is recommended to set up a ""parking watchman"". After the general public participates in the course training, those who pass the exam can obtain a license. The content of the work is: impose fines for illegal parking, and take the initiative to check and report the abandoned vehicles occupying the road. The specific setting method of ""Parking Monitor"" can be modeled after ""Street Parking Biller"". I believe everyone is familiar with the figure of ""street parking biller"" shuttling through the streets and alleys to bill. Since the ""legal parking space"" can hire a commissioner to issue a ticket, then of course the ""illegal parking"" can also be issued a ticket by the commissioner. The ""parking watchman"" should be on duty in accordance with the standards of public servants. If the public attempts to attack or threaten the person, he will be punished according to the crime of ""obstructing public affairs"". Every violation is a potentially murderous weapon, and you think you\'re just pausing and not affecting others, when in fact you\'re an attempted murder. I hope that the country can face up to the banning of traffic violations, and don\'t let hundreds of thousands of sad families shed tears every year.']"

In recent years, many gender equality campaigns have been carried out one after another. The ""different functional roles in social life"" can no longer be roughly divided into ""male and female"" genders, so how can the ""Military Service Law"" stick to the rules? The recent responses of the Ministry of National Defense on related issues have committed many of the above fallacies. Even though the Ministry of the Interior reminded to ""examine the principle of equality in terms of the legislative purpose of the Military Service Act and whether the differential treatment is reasonable"", it still did not carefully compare the application of the ""temporary special measures"" regulated by Article 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It has also never considered amending this law as a ""temporary special measure"". This makes it difficult to stop using this system after the goal of equal opportunity and treatment between men and women is achieved as stated in Article 4 of the Convention. What is more, the military service system actually creates the phenomena that ""lead to the maintenance of unequal standards or the establishment of alternative standards"" prohibited by the Convention. If this system cannot be clearly expressed as ""preferential differential treatment"", it will inevitably strengthen the gender discrimination mentioned above. Therefore, even if this system is to be maintained, the law should be amended to make it a ""temporary special measure"". The Ministry of National Defense believes that the national military service system is ""defined by the laws of most countries."" However, in practice most countries do not require their citizens to perform military service or receive military training. In 2003, the European Court of Justice ruled that German male conscription violated the European Union\'s equal treatment directive. The United States currently only retains conscription in law. In June 2016, the Senate included women in the conscription bill; in 2013, Norway passed the female conscription bill, which was implemented in 2016; Sweden will also restore gender-neutral conscription in 2018. Although these countries are not in the majority, they may not be unable to provide reference for our country. The Ministry of National Defense believes that after the implementation of the transformation of the recruitment system, ""women who meet service standards and are interested in military professional work can join the ranks of the national army."" However, the status quo of the ""Military Service Law"" is not what the transformation of the recruitment system has been completed. If the government really wants to implement the transformation of the recruitment system, it must abolish the ""Military Service Law"" that forces men to perform military service and military training. In order to ""allow men who meet service standards and aspire to engage in military professional work to join the ranks of the national army."" Therefore, the revision of the ""Military Service Law"" is necessary. Only gender-neutral conscription, or no conscription at all, can promote gender equality.', 'In 2019, cross-Strait relations became tense, and a military recruitment system was advocated in parallel with men and women serving in military training to make up for the shortage of soldiers; men and women have the common duty to defend the country._Article 1 of the ""Military Service Law"" stipulates: ""Men in the Republic of China are obliged to perform military service according to the law.""

And Article 10, Item 8 of the ""Constitutional Amendments"" states: ""The state shall safeguard the personal dignity of women, protect the personal safety of women, eliminate gender discrimination, and promote the substantive equality of gender status."" The principle of gender equality stipulated. This issue was raised three years ago, and now that it has been changed to a comprehensive recruitment system, I hope the government can make adjustments to this proposal again. At present, the national defense has changed to a comprehensive recruitment system in 2018, but men in the Republic of China still have to serve 4 months of military training. Compared with female citizens, this has not fully implemented social fairness and justice. Men still have to be deprived of a short period of time to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the law. Today\'s society is becoming more open and women are gradually emerging in various fields. Therefore, women should have the ability to perform military service and must fulfill the obligations stipulated by the law together with men. In the previous ""Military Service Law,"" the article on gender inequality was amended. The obligation of national military service does not differ according to biological sex. ’” mentioned in this proposal, “The Council of Justices will position the principle of equality as “substantial equality in legal status””. Today, women’s abilities are basically not much different from men’s, and the “biological difference between men and women” has been considered by the outside world to be compensated by relevant measures. In today\'s international sports competitions, there are all outstanding results. When female athletes participate in training, they should be accompanied by physical problems. However, female athletes can overcome them, receive corresponding training, and participate in competitions. Therefore, physical differences may no longer be the reason why women cannot receive military training. ""After the transformation of the military service system in our country, we have also gradually expanded the use of female manpower from society, so that women who meet the service standards and are interested in military professional work can join the ranks of the national army, and review the number of personnel and service system environment year by year to ensure gender equality and work rights."" The current recruitment system has been implemented for one year, and the relevant units know that the recruitment effect is not as expected. There are also many active female surnames in the ranks of the national army. To fulfill the obligation of national defense. In today\'s increasingly tense cross-strait relations, it is not a bad idea to include female nationals in the scope of the 4-month military training service. After implementation, it will be more effective in realizing real social fairness and justice, and achieving the long-awaited gender equality in society. Both male and female citizens are citizens of the Republic of China. There should be no conditional differences in the constitution in today’s society. The traditional society believes that women have children, and the concept of men defending the country was established in an era when women’s social status has not yet been improved. In today’s society, there are many female talents, and childbearing is no longer the only life choice for women. In addition, childbearing is no longer necessary in the current social concept. Women can choose whether to conceive and have children at an appropriate time. Military service does not have the right to choose under the current law. Therefore, under the condition of emphasizing ""social equality"", women\'s military service is a necessary reform, and it can satisfy social fairness and justice and make up for the shortage of soldiers. The burden of defending the country is no longer just the obligation of male citizens. It is hoped that the government can encourage both male and female citizens to work together to make the society more harmonious and progressive.', 'Amend the provisions of the ""Military Service Law"" referring to gender and related provisions or abolish any forced military system imposed on citizens by the ""Military Service Law""_The current military service law was first enacted in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, stating that all men in our country have the obligation to perform military service.

Proposals or Suggestions Reason 1: Although electronic bills have been issued for a long time, they cannot be fully implemented. The government must use the Internet and big data to combine assets and financial functions to improve the industry. At present, the financial industry has already used or is actively investing in research and development of various payment functions. All consumption information is accessed with big data. Consumers can already check the details and confirm the correctness of consumption on the Internet, but there is no unified method for payment companies and financial companies. Suggestion: Let the financial industry provide virtual accounts for those who will use the payment function, and consider promoting accounts without savings books. (You can refer to the bank account opening method in Australia, and have three virtual accounts including flexible transfer account, short-term savings, and long-term savings.) And add online accounts according to your own financial planning. Virtually combine various payment functions, such as MRT, consumption, payment, etc., and bind it to a virtual flexible account in a personal bank. This virtual flexible account can transfer funds to different internal and external banks. If there is no amount in the virtual account, the transaction will fail. Online transfers can be made to this virtual account to use the payment function. Reason 2: The utilization rate of uniform invoices is low. Except for relevant large and medium-sized enterprises, most small and medium-sized self-employed businesses do not use invoices, such as beverages, catering, leisure and recreational equipment (fitness) and so on. Most people may directly throw them away at will, causing a mess in the environment, and they cannot recycle paper. The low winning rate cannot stimulate the domestic demand economy, but they are willing to spend money to buy the lottery. Suggestion: cancel all physical invoices, completely paperless, and return to the household. Consumers who do not have an account or are young self-contained consumers must issue consumption vouchers and redeem prizes by their legal representative. In addition to the basic tax, a certain amount of fee tax (paper tax, etc.) must be deducted. Those who return to the household shall be deducted according to the tax rate. Merge the Taiwan lottery ticket and the unified invoice, and all the non-winning amount of the Taiwan lottery in each period will be accumulated in proportion to the next unified invoice for redemption. And re-draft the uniform invoice award. For example: increase the number of special prize number groups from 1 group to 10 groups and change the amount to 1 million, increase the number of first prize number groups from 3 groups to 10 groups, and expect other awards to match the number of first prize numbers according to the original plan. However, if you receive a physical invoice, the award will be halved.']"

Plastic straw restriction policy in July 2018: In the plastic restriction policy that will be implemented on July 1 this year, it is stipulated that government departments, schools, department stores, shopping centers, fast food chains and other four types of places are not allowed to provide disposable plastic straws for ""internal use"". Originally, straws coated and laminated with plastic film with a plastic content of less than 10% by weight were also allowed to be banned, but straws such as bagasse, paper, and biodegradable plastics were allowed as alternatives. (2) Suggestions (future) 1. The current plastic restriction policy has not been extended to night markets, vegetable markets and food stalls. However, most of our livelihood consumption is here. For example, when buying vegetables in the vegetable market, most consumers are used to packing different types of vegetables in different plastic bags, plus meat and seafood must be bagged separately, and finally put vegetables and meat in large plastic bags. In this way, the number of plastic bags that each consumer needs is very surprising. 2. Therefore, we believe that the plastic restriction policy should be extended to night markets, vegetable markets, and food stalls. Only then will the use of plastic bags be truly reduced, and the plastic restriction policy will not become empty talk. The government also needs to encourage the private sector to sell a variety of reusable bags and other products that can replace plastic bags. Schools should also set up relevant environmental protection courses, so that our next generation will have the concept of caring for the earth from an early age, and can also put the concept into practice. 3. In terms of policy implementation, we believe that in addition to expanding the scope of plastic restrictions, the purchase price of plastic bags should also be increased, so as to deter the public. We will give rewards to stores that obey the policy obediently, and we will give penalties to stores that do not comply with the policy. And use the whistle-blowing system, that is, after the government has finished publicizing, it is not enough to just rely on the police to issue bills for unruly stores. People should be encouraged to report and rewarded.', 'Levy a plastic tax to make the environment better together_The government has set a policy requiring most stores not to provide free plastic bags. The purpose is to reduce the use of plastic bags by the public. Because the cost of plastic bags set by various companies is mostly a drop in the bucket for consumers, it has no significant effect on reducing the willingness to use. Moreover, there is a gap between the income and cost of plastic bags, which will lead to the situation of profit-seeking businesses. If the cash flow is concentrated on environmental protection education and other activities, the goal of plastic reduction actions can be achieved. Specific matters: collection of tax on plastic bags (EX: increase the purchase of a plastic bag to more than 10 yuan (inclusive) or the government overcharges the manufacturing tax or raw material tax of plastic bags), or reduce external costs by means of Pigou tax (EX: cigarette donation... how much money is pumped for each plastic bag, etc.) Method: reduce people’s willingness (demand) to use plastic bags through price control Billion single-use plastic bags are used. And from 2020, the asking price of each plastic shopping bag will increase to 10p', ""Suggestions on Environmental Reform - Plastic Bags_Suggestions for environmental protection reform A news report about cetaceans, sea turtles, and seabirds eating plastic bags by mistake caused indigestion, starvation, dehydration and death, and plastics release chemicals harmful to the human body and the environment. Countries such as India, the United States, and Morocco have begun to take action on the problem of plastic pollution, promulgating laws and regulations that completely ban plastic bags, Styrofoam (polystyrene) and other plastic products. Take a look around your everyday life and it's not hard to see that plastic is everywhere. Disposable tableware for eating out, hand-cranked cold drink cups and (its partner) straws, cold plastic bottles of drinks in the refrigerators of convenience stores, plastic bags for packaging fresh fruits and vegetables in the market, containers for maintenance and cleaning supplies in bottles and cans... Life has been occupied by all kinds of plastic products. They seem to provide human convenience at the moment, but they cause permanent inconvenience and even death to marine life. Among them, the average use time of plastic bags is the shortest, often providing human beings with a few minutes of one-time convenience, but it brings a fatal crisis to marine life, because after leaving the hands of people, its end may not end in incinerators, landfills or recycling plants, but flow into the sea. In 2013 Taiwan's coastal waste list, plastic bags still topped the list. Even if nature spends more than hundreds of years, it still cannot decompose it. After several centuries, your children and grandchildren may still see the discarded plastic bags used by our generation. 1. It is suggested to legislate and formulate a national ban on plastic bags, and at the same time publicize it in major media, and complete the legislation and formulate a national ban on plastic bags within 4 years of administration. 2. During the promulgation of the plastic bag ban, illegal plastics will be seized. 3. Set up an illegal plastic reporting network and set up incentives to encourage the public to report. 4. Legislate to prohibit factories from producing and importing single-use plastic shopping bags. 5. Slowly banning plastic bags is harmful to the present and future generations. It is necessary to legislate to completely ban plastic bags as soon as possible. 6. To be promoted to an advanced international country, plastic bags must be banned comprehensively. http://www.greenpeace.org/taiwan/zh/news/stories/oceans/2016/6-places-ban-plastic/""]"

Due to low wages and high working hours, coupled with some social and cultural factors (for example, the proportion of men who take family care leave and parental leave and other related leave is still significantly lower than that of women. Or when taking parental leave or family care leave, etc., they may encounter difficulties, etc.), which makes them afraid to have children. Even after giving birth, many young parents have very limited time to accompany their children due to long working hours. However, the fees of private childcare centers are very expensive. Under the relatively harsh labor conditions in Taiwan, such fees are actually not a small burden for young parents. However, Taiwan's public childcare resources are also insufficient, resulting in public childcare resources that are relatively cheap and of relatively stable quality becoming unattainable. But every time such a problem is encountered, the government's approach is usually to throw money, but this is a palliative, not a permanent solution! Now the government is pushing for long-term care 2.0, and is working hard to set up day-care centers in the community. In the case of insufficient public childcare resources, is it possible to combine childcare resources with day-care centers, and provide good working conditions and working environment (enabling childcare workers to work near their homes), quality care and relatively cheap fees, so as to reduce the childcare burden of young parents?"", 'The government is requested to plan to set the policy of ""partial reduction and exemption of people\'s livelihood (public) consumption"" according to the ""number of children born in a household""._The government has always been aware that the declining birthrate and aging population are not only hidden dangers for national development, but have even begun to appear in crisis in some areas (for example: pension application), so the government proposes to formulate relevant policies to deal with the declining birthrate at the ""national security level"". Over the past ten years, visible relevant policies have been proposed: maternity subsidies, childcare subsidies, labor, (public, national) childcare subsidies of various local governments, childcare leave without pay, and increased comprehensive tax exemptions. After setting the tone of the argument that ""fewer births are a national security issue,"" local governments have also increased maternity subsidies depending on their financial conditions, and lower-level townships and cities have also proposed their own versions of ""increased rewards"" if their financial conditions permit. However, statistics show that since 2020, my country has experienced a death cross between fertility and mortality, that is, the birth rate is lower than the death rate for the first time, which means that the total number of people in our country has begun to decrease. The national crisis brought about by such a changing trend is: the reduction of national productivity, the decline of overall consumption ability, the increase of medical expenses caused by the aging of the people, the imbalance of annuity payment conditions (fewer people pay, more people receive), etc., the impact of the decline in fertility rate and even an aging society can be seen in general. But in terms of trends, why does the birth rate continue to decline after the government has proposed various subsidies and incentives? When exploring the reasons for the declining birth rate, everyone refers to economic factors, such as ""how can I raise children if I can\'t make money?"", ""how can I raise children when prices are so expensive?"" However, based on the analysis of the current existing policies: maternity subsidies, labor, (public, state) maternity allowances can only be subsidies received in the nature of rewards, and the actual income is far from enough to buy diapers and milk powder for children, let alone the long process of raising children. Childcare subsidies can indeed solve the urgent needs of young double-income couples. The reduction of the comprehensive income tax exemption can only be happy once a year, and the childcare leave without pay must also worry about whether there will be suitable job vacancies after the expiration. From the perspective of policy marketing, the government certainly has good intentions, but it does not seem very attractive. ""How can I raise a child if I can\'t make money?"", ""How can I raise a child if the price is so expensive?"", ""Raising a child costs money for everything,,,"", judging from the concerns of these young parents, the real reason why they dare not have children is the bit by bit, the constant economic pressure. There are too many internal and external factors that affect the country\'s economic conditions, and it is not possible to feel it for a while; but it can be felt all the time and deeply to reduce the financial pressure of young parents. If public resources can be converted into long-term and sustainable ""living allowances"", that is, young parents can think that my household expenditure ratio will be reduced after giving birth to children; I can actually feel the economic benefits of having children every month, so that I can truly increase my willingness to have children from the source.', ""Please modify the countermeasures against childcare for children under the age of 2: the quasi-public mechanism for childcare, and the provision that childcare subsidies and childcare allowances cannot be claimed at the same time in the expanded childcare allowance policy_The new system from August 1, 2017 stipulates that if you apply for a childcare subsidy of up to 6,000 yuan, you cannot apply for a childcare subsidy. The government said that 6,000 yuan is more than 2,500 yuan, which is good for the people. That's right, 6,000 yuan is more than 2,500 yuan. The problem is that 8,500 yuan (2,500 yuan childcare allowance + 6,000 yuan childcare subsidy) is not more than 6,000 yuan? Why does the new system stipulate that after claiming childcare subsidy, you can no longer claim childcare subsidy? 1. The government itself also said that childcare subsidy and childcare subsidy are different in nature. Since the nature is different, why is it forbidden to apply for it at the same time? 2. Is it true that kindergartens help parents take care of their children 24 hours a day? How many families do not take care of their children after work? How many families do not take care of their children after work? This is not considered childcare? Can’t receive childcare allowances? 3. The policy stipulates that childcare expenses should be controlled at 10-15% of the family’s disposable income (about 8,000 to 12,000 yuan), in order to substantially reduce the burden on parents. 19,927 yuan per month, after deducting the original childcare allowance + childcare subsidy, it barely reaches 11,427 yuan.

The speed limit of the inner lane of the expressway is higher than the speed limit of the other lanes. It is a veritable passing lane. If the speed limit of the passing lane is the same as that of other lanes, it will often occupy the inner lane. 2. Nowadays, most vehicles can reach the maximum speed limit of the expressway. The maximum speed limit should be raised so that there will be less traffic jams. 3. The government should strengthen publicity and ban vehicles that occupy the passing lane.', 'Amended Article 8, Item 1, Subparagraph 3 of the Expressway and Expressway Traffic Control Rules, the inner lane is the overtaking lane, and the inner lane should be kept clear except for overtaking_Article 8, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 3 of the original expressway and expressway traffic control regulations stipulates: ""The inner lane is the overtaking lane. However, small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed on the road section if there is no traffic jam."" The function of the expressway and expressway itself is to provide passers-by with a fast and safe way to reach the destination. However, although this regulation has defined the inner lane as the overtaking lane, there is a proviso that small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed on the road section if there is no traffic jam. In the description of this regulation, the traffic conditions without congestion and the maximum speed limit are very vague definitions. What is a blockage? two cars? Three cars or four cars? How much lower is the speed? Vehicle density within one kilometer of a single lane (inner, middle, outer)? Top speed limit? The speed limit on the car\'s dashboard? GPS speed limit? 110 km/h? Or add 119 km/h within the allowable range? The above two nouns are very vague terms, and there is no clear definition of how to distinguish them. As a result, people\'s interpretation of the regulations is distorted, thinking that keeping a speed of 100 km/h or more is the highest speed limit, and they can drive in the inner lane for a long time and for a long distance. But the speedometer of each car is different. Maybe you have reached 100 km/h or more, but my car has not, so what should I do? In this way, everyone\'s perception of the regulations is absolutely strange. You can imagine the weird scene of overtaking lanes formed on the outer lines of the expressway. This provision shall take the initial purpose of the highway as the starting point, and the principle of priority to reach the destination priority safely and quickly should define this provision as ""the inner lane is overtaking. In addition to overtaking, it shall not stay in the inner lane. Of course, the national road police should also increase the frequency of law enforcement and avoid over -speed ban to avoid unscrupulous parts through the inside. The side lanes drive at a speed at a high speed to endanger the safety of others. Finally, the inner side should be a simple overtaking lane. Even if you drive no matter how much you use, you cannot take up for a long time. Giving way to the overtaking lane and whether the vehicle behind is speeding are two different things and should not be confused. After overtaking, you should immediately give way to the overtaking lane. If the vehicle behind is speeding, it can be reported to the National Highway Police to ban it. If you have a qualified reporting device, you can also use the method of reporting for the police to ban. Only in this way can we re-establish the use order of the lanes on the expressway, increase the speed of the expressway, and establish a friendly driving environment! Foreign countries already have a very mature concept of driving. We should learn from them. After the overall quality of the people in our country is improved, it may not be a dream to have unlimited speed highways one day. I hope that the Ministry of Communications and the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior will pay attention to this issue. I don’t think political officials want to be scolded for traffic jams every time they have consecutive holidays! To encourage each other', ""Domestic expressways and expressways should legislate to increase the speed limit of the inner lane, and effectively implement the concept of using the inner overtaking lane._Preface Based on more than 15 years of driving experience and observations on national highways and expressways at home and abroad, the author understands that Chinese people still have insufficient knowledge of highway driving and driving, which leads to frequent accidents on domestic highways and extremely serious congestion. Argument According to the advanced road design and use cognition at home and abroad, the inner (most left) lane of the expressway is designed to be the best use efficiency. It should be an overtaking lane and should be kept clear and high-speed at all times to ensure that vehicles in this lane can effectively overtake vehicles in the middle and outer lanes. And let other vehicles brake frequently to slow down the average speed of the overall expressway; According to the theory of traffic science, the expressway is a miniature version of the butterfly effect. When a few vehicles brake improperly or frequently, it will easily lead to traffic jams in the rear section. Taiwan's expressways are inefficient and extremely prone to traffic jams. This problem should be solved. Proposal Based on the above reasons, the author proposes to adopt the simplest law improvement method, which is to increase the legal speed limit of the inner lane, so as to encourage the pedestrians to increase the speed of the inner lane, and to force the occupants to leave the lane at high speed and give way. The increased speed limit should be at least 10-20km/h higher than the maximum speed limit of the road section. For example, the inner lane of a section with a speed of 100 kilometers per hour should be 110-120 kilometers per hour. In addition to increasing the speed limit of the inner lane, regulations should also be added to require that when a vehicle in the middle and outer lane intends to overtake a vehicle approaching on the left, it should allow the vehicle on the left to enter the lane for overtaking. Strengthen the norms of overtaking behavior to avoid danger and slow down of vehicles on national roads caused by frequent braking due to improper behavior of other vehicles. Amendments to Regulations The following provisions should be amended as proposed above to increase the permissible speed limit for small cars on the inner lane. According to Article 8, Example 3 of Expressway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulations, the inside lane is the overtaking lane. However, small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed by the road section under the condition of not blocking the traffic. In addition, the behavior regulations of overtaking vehicles and vehicles being overtaken should be strengthened. If the vehicle intends to overtake another vehicle, it must flash the direction lights and speed up to overtake; while in the middle and outer lanes, if the vehicle on the left wants to turn into the bicycle lane, it should give way without speeding up.""]"

According to Article 22, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 5 of the Food Safety and Sanitation Management Law: ""Containers or outer packaging of food and food raw materials shall clearly indicate the name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer or domestic responsible manufacturer in Chinese and common symbols""; Article 22 Paragraph 4: ""If only the name of the domestic responsible manufacturer is marked in Subparagraph 5 of Paragraph 1, the name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer, entrusted manufacturer, or importing manufacturer shall be notified to the competent authority in the jurisdiction; the competent authority shall open it to other competent authorities for common inspection""; Paragraph: ""Containers or outer packaging of food additives and their raw materials shall clearly indicate the name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer or domestic responsible manufacturer in Chinese and common symbols""; Item 3 of Article 24: ""If only the name of the domestic responsible manufacturer is indicated in Subparagraph 5 of Paragraph 1, the name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer, entrusted manufacturer or importer shall be notified to the competent authority in the jurisdiction; the competent authority shall open it to other competent authorities for common inspection."" 2. Regarding the above-mentioned decrees, the legislators are concerned that international laws and regulations do not have strict requirements on food labeling to indicate the manufacturing plant and manufacturer. In order to avoid import traders from incurring a large amount of input costs due to the special requirements of the national laws and regulations, this decree follows the spirit of international legislation. Only the domestic responsible manufacturer or the manufacturer or both can be marked on the outer packaging of the food. 3. In view of the frequent occurrence of food safety storms in Taiwan, people in the country are worried about whether the government needs to manage food safety and hygiene. However, it has been verified that Articles 22 and 24 of the Food Safety and Hygiene Management Law stipulate that the legislator adopts a self-reporting model for food labeling only [domestic responsible manufacturers], so that the industry can report the manufacturer and its information to the local competent authority in a self-disciplined manner in accordance with the law, so that the local competent authority can create a file on the system for other subjective agencies to query. However, the disclosure of government information and the unification of various laws and regulations should be considered, and it should be open to the public to inquire about the name of the manufacturer. This book is not a business secret, and should not be classified as confidential. It is also a legal commodity. Article 9 of the Product Labeling Law can be done very well. For imports, producers, and license manufacturers, the name of the manufacturer should be marked. The quality of the product also allows the public to jointly supervise the manufacturer. In addition, the Medical Device Management Law and the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law also stipulate that the manufacturer should be marked on the packaging of the product (Article 33 of the Medical Device Management Law, Article 75 of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and Article 20 of the Drug Inspection and Registration Review Guidelines). The spirit of supervision, the standards for jointly cracking down on unscrupulous and unscrupulous food companies, is open to public inquiries, so as to prevent unscrupulous operators from taking advantage of this loophole to avoid government inspections (lack of manpower), lack of public supervision, and cause Taiwanese people to eat unscrupulous food, resulting in breaches in food safety. 4. Item 4 of Article 8 of the Food Safety and Hygienic Management Law has legislated to require food to be registered as a food business with the local competent authority in accordance with the food business registration method, also known as non-registration, so that it can be put on the shelves through food and medicine, and food businesses continue to register one after another. However, the registered businesses are limited to the manufacturing and processing industry, catering industry, import industry, sales industry, and logistics industry. However, consideration should be given to the public. This page only has the name, address, and registration number of the business, and lacks product information. In addition, manufacturers in Articles 22 and 24 of the Food Safety and Sanitation Management Law should be able to follow this method and require the manufacturer\'s information to be registered in the product and open to public inquiries.', 'Proposal for ""traffic light"" food labeling image, red light food will add warnings on the front of the package_<<Preface>> ""What is food nutrition labeling?

In order to improve your and my health, please support the proposal, please forward it to the FB, Line group. At present, the obesity rate of adults and school children in China is the highest in Asia. Among the top 10 causes of death in China, 8 causes of death are related to obesity. It can be seen that body weight is closely related to mortality. To prevent people from eating too much high-calorie, high-fat and other foods, leading to obesity, chronic diseases and other diseases. First, it causes difficulties in reading for the elderly and school-age children, which limits the warning effect. It is hoped that by improving the method of nutrition labeling, consumers can have a better understanding of food and provide an easier basis for judgment through graphic representation. <<Current Practices of the Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare>> In addition to the second provision, the calorie and nutrient content labeling of packaged foods should be handled in accordance with the following regulations: (1) Label with ""per serving (or serving)"" and ""per 100 grams (or milliliters)"", and indicate the number of servings contained in each package of the product. (2) Label with ""amount per serving (or per serving)"" and the ""percentage of daily reference value"" provided, and indicate the number of servings contained in each package of the product. Units for nutrition labeling of packaged foods shall comply with the following regulations: (1) Solid (semi-solid) shall be expressed in grams, and liquids shall be expressed in milliliters. (2) Calories are expressed in kcal. (3) Proteins, fats, fatty acids, carbohydrates, sugars, and dietary fiber are indicated in grams. (4) Sodium, cholesterol, and amino acids are expressed in milligrams. (5) Unit labeling of vitamins and minerals shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2. (6) Other nutrients are marked in common units. (Source: Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare) Are you dizzy after seeing the above regulations of the Food and Drug Administration? According to the Fengshi Foundation, Taiwanese consumers generally have low awareness of nutrition and ingredient labeling! A research survey on packaging labeling was carried out among Taiwanese people. The survey period was from June 28 to July 12, 2016. 58% of the respondents will check the label when buying packaged food, and 95% of the respondents will check the expiration date. Secondly, 74% of the respondents care about the ingredients, while only 43% of the respondents will read the content of the nutrition label. Statistics show that more than half of the public will ignore the information of ""Nutrition Labeling"". Among the respondents who “have never checked or rarely checked food packaging labels”, nearly 50% of the respondents think that the font size of the labels is too small, 40% think that they have decided to buy and don’t mind whether there are labels, 30% can’t understand the labels, and at least 10% think that the location of the labels is not obvious. From the survey, it can be found that less than half of the people pay attention to the current nutrition labels, and there is a need for improvement. (Source: Fengshi Foundation and Foodnext.net/) <<Overseas practice>>Britain uses red, yellow and green colors to make nutrition labels easier to understand. Red means high levels, yellow means medium levels, and green means low levels. The red mark means that certain foods contain more than the recommended intake, which is not conducive to maintaining health. The public can use the icon to achieve a warning effect. The yellow mark means that a certain ingredient in the food is neither high nor low. Most of the time, it is acceptable to choose this kind of food. The green mark means that the content of a certain ingredient in the food is very low, and the food with more green marks is more beneficial to health. <<Recommended practice>> 1. The proposal adopts the traffic light labeling method similar to that in the UK (or divided into 5 levels), mainly for the four major categories of graphic labeling: 1. Calories 2. Sugar 3. Sodium 4. Fat (trans fat, saturated fat, fat), according to the Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare to evaluate whether the recommended intake standard is exceeded. For example, if the calorie exceeds the recommended intake, the food must be marked with a red indicator on the calorie graph, so that consumers can see it at a glance and can choose beneficial foods more quickly, hoping to guide consumers to shop healthily. 2. As long as two or more of the four categories are red indicators, the food must have a warning on the front of the product: ""Eating high ○○ food is harmful to health"" and other slogans.', 'It is forbidden to call food as health food unless it has passed the inspection of the Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Service_On February 3, 1988, the Health Food Management Law was announced by the President in 20 years in accordance with Article 2 in the 20th year of the Health Food Management Law: ""Healthy food referred to in this law refers to food that has health effects and marked or advertised its efficacy."" Also 2 items: ""The health effect referred to this law refers to improving people\'s health and reducing the risk of disease hazards, and has the effect of substantial scientific evidence. The medical effectiveness of treatment and correction of human diseases, and the announcement of the central competent authority.

(This announcement will be abolished on May 27, 2019, and the above-mentioned health effects will be announced in the form of regulations) The law has classified specific health effects as health foods, and offenders can be punished. However, there are many unscrupulous food industry operators who have declared it as a health food in other ways. Not only do they have no proof to prove that it has improvement effects, they walk around the edge of the law. Therefore, I propose that the government should strengthen legislation or amend the law to add regulations on health food, whether it is a legal term, or what kind of effect it has. In addition, health food that has not passed the inspection of the Food and Drug Administration should not be declared as a health food.']"

Although in Taiwan, as long as you pay health insurance premiums, you can enjoy the same medical services, regardless of whether you are rich or poor, but we know that health insurance is wasted by some people through improper medical practices. However, because every insurer pays health insurance fees every month, he enjoys the protection of health insurance payment, regardless of whether his behavior of using health insurance is restrained or legitimate. Taiwan’s health insurance system should guarantee and provide adequate medical care for Taiwanese. It is a matter of enjoying Taiwan’s health insurance in a reasonable and legal manner, and Taiwan’s health insurance is already a matter of public interest. Therefore, it should be ruled out that those who slander and disrupt social order and unity against the health insurance provider country and report to China indiscriminately target those who are Taiwan independence. We strongly urge the former Legislative Yuan to redefine the exclusion of money from health insurance recipients for the behavior of people like Huang An, so as to achieve the principle of fairness, justice and justice for Taiwan’s health insurance users."", ""Let health insurance return to the form of insurance - insurance as the mainstay, supplemented by social welfare_At this stage, people working overseas with health insurance cannot verify their income, so they can use the minimum insurance amount (900 yuan) to guarantee the use of health insurance. It is easy to cause resource abuse, so that people who need health insurance cannot really get resources and accelerate the risk of health insurance bankruptcy. In addition, some people who misuse health insurance as an all-you-can-eat resource also need to adjust the amount of insurance and limit the use of it, just like the medical insurance launched by various financial institutions. The current health insurance grades are as follows https://www.nhi.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=74D1AF4F883FB56D&topn=5FE8C9FEAE863B46 The insured amount ranges from 900 to 6400 depending on income. The health insurance adjustment plan is as follows. 3 days (half a year). For those who have not lived for more than half a year, the insurance amount will be increased (the scope of the increase will be assessed by financial and insurance experts). Like most medical insurance or accident insurance, long-term living in dangerous places (areas with poor sanitation conditions, areas with frequent wars, etc.) has a higher risk of returning to use health insurance due to illness, so it is natural to need to adjust the premium (determining the cost for additional discussion-requires financial and insurance experts to assist in the assessment)- (if you live in the area because of charity or medical assistance, you can provide proof and use the minimum insurance amount) Health insurance (consulting and receiving medicine) (unless the doctor confirms different medical conditions or the medicine is ineffective or needs to be adjusted - according to the doctor's professional assessment - if it is found after the self-paid consultation that adjustments are needed or the situation is different, a supplementary application for health insurance can be made) 3-1: Supplement It is like a hospital or clinic repeatedly overturning the assessment, but prescribing similar medicines. The government needs to come forward to supervise whether there is any suspicion of fraudulently receiving health insurance. 4. People who have lived overseas for a long time and come back to use health insurance after suffering a serious illness. Normal payment for health insurance use, but the premium will automatically increase from next month (such as insurance from various financial institutions - you are prone to illness and naturally the premium is more expensive) 5. Others such as: Taiwan identity holders, Taiwan residence permit holders - as usual"", 'Complete and complete reform of health insurance solutions - a complete solution to the loss of health insurance_Complete and thorough reform of health insurance solutions to completely solve the loss of health insurance 1. Payment by use ratio: pay health insurance premiums according to the status and frequency of use of health insurance, regardless of age. 2. The controversy that the health insurance premiums for criminals held in detention centers should be borne by the whole people: all criminals held in detention centers and criminals in jail need to work in prison or use social work to pay for health insurance. 3. The National Health Insurance Administration uses fictitious income to charge people with no working income the same health insurance premiums, falsely claiming that all have unemployment subsidies and low-income household subsidies: compared with all people in Taiwan, people without working income and low-income households pay less health insurance premiums, but they also pay according to the proportion of use: regardless of age, health insurance premiums are paid according to the status and frequency of use of health insurance. 4. Health insurance rats: According to Taiwan media citing statistics from the National Health Insurance Administration, in 2015, 57,000 people returned to Taiwan for medical treatment and then withdrawn their insurance halfway. These people are also called health insurance rats by the media. Before the health insurance rats leave the stage, they must pay off the previously accumulated health insurance premiums, otherwise they will be punished and permanently denied health insurance. 5. Specialists in internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics have a high risk of medical disputes and a heavy burden, but the benefits of national health insurance obviously do not reflect the risks and burdens of these specialties, making it difficult for these four departments to recruit enough new blood and talents. 6. Drug price black hole: If a disease is treated and paid for at a price; or paid on a per-person basis, medical institutions will consider the final economic benefits, and medicines are included in a larger payment unit (either on the disease or on the person), and the drug price black hole is naturally meaningless. However, this system also has disadvantages. Because the difficulty of treatment for the same disease varies from person to person, many previous examples show that hospitals will be more willing to reject patients who are more difficult to treat (such as the elderly and those with complicated conditions, although this system will give these patients higher benefits), and hospitals will discharge patients early because the patient\'s benefits have been exhausted...etc. Unfavorable consequences for patients. Hospitals discharge patients early due to the exhaustion of the patient\'s benefits...and other unfavorable consequences for patients set relevant severe penalties. 7. Medical staff should avoid overtime work. However, some senior doctors still have the concept that ""long-term overwork is a necessary training to become a qualified doctor"", which is also a factor that causes young doctors to overwork. Mandatory legislation stipulates the length of working hours of medical staff, sets up a medical malpractice reporting website and sets up a reward and punishment system, and provides channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. Number of visits, performance issues: large hospitals will go all out to see a doctor regardless of the real needs of patients. The relevant penalties are stipulated in the legislation, and a medical malpractice reporting website is also set up and a reward and punishment system is set up to provide channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. 8. Doctor elimination system: For medical disputes, we also set up a medical malpractice reporting website and set up a reward and punishment system to provide channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. Serious cases will be dismissed for life. 9. The cost of medical care is moderately increased, and payment is made according to the proportion of use, including self-pay and health insurance. 10. Hospital certification reward and punishment system, set up a Taiwan-wide hospital certification website, and formulate a reward and punishment system. For those who are unqualified and refuse to listen to repeated persuasion, the hospital will not be included in the scope of health insurance if the situation is serious, until it improves. 11. Hospitals across Taiwan have established a joint network of health insurance: record the integrity of medical records, avoid abuse of health insurance resources and improve medical quality. I hope Minister of Health and Welfare Lin Zuoyan formulate it as soon as possible, and bring benefits to the health of the general public. I hope that all members of the Legislative Yuan and Minister of Health and Welfare Lin Zuoyan will adopt and implement it.']"

Differential treatment of labor and military, public and educational taxes. , Pensions that are not insurance benefits and insurance benefits from annuity insurance in accordance with the provisions of the Labor Pension Regulations. Therefore, the public insurance old-age benefits received by the military public education and the labor insurance old-age benefits received by the laborers when they retire are not within the scope of the definition of retirement income. Currently, the retired income of military public education and labor is the statutory retirement fund pension and labor pension (that is, the new labor retirement system or the old labor retirement system). , is included in the calculation of salary income of personal comprehensive income tax every year, and when employees are working, if they voluntarily contribute up to 6% of the pension in a special account for labor retirement every month, they are exempted from being included in the calculation of salary income of personal comprehensive income tax every year. They are only included in the retirement income tax when receiving pensions at retirement. In response to the above situation, the Ministry of Finance replied: military public education is ""exemption before and after taxation"", while labor is ""exempt from taxation before and after tax"".

Regardless of whether it is a laborer or a military public education, according to the current law, as long as the service has reached 15 years, you can choose whether to receive a monthly occupational pension. In terms of military public education, because the current pension system has been implemented for more than 20 years, more than 90% of the retired military public education choose monthly retirement pension; in terms of labor, because the new labor retirement system will not expire until 109/06/30 for 15 years, then only qualified workers can choose whether to receive monthly labor.

According to the situation of monthly labor insurance old-age benefits, there should be more than 80% or higher proportion of retired workers who will choose to receive monthly labor retirement special account pension in the future. It can be known that retired workers have to receive a monthly pension of more than 54,166 yuan from a special account for labor retirement before they can be included in the calculation of income tax. According to the report of the annual reform committee, there is no such thing as a worker who can receive a pension of 54,166 yuan a month in a special account for labor retirement.

Without increasing the total number of vacation days throughout the year, through the current flexible leave adjustment and make-up work methods, in conjunction with the shift of vacation days, the annual Spring Festival holiday is fixed at ten days. To relieve traffic congestion, develop sightseeing and tourism, promote consumption activities, improve leisure products, and activate economic pulse. 2. The current Spring Festival holiday, except that the first day of the holiday falls on Tuesday or the last day of the holiday falls on Thursday, the Spring Festival holiday will be extended to 10 days through flexible adjustments and make-up work. The New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 3. To improve leisure products, promote consumption activities, relieve traffic congestion, develop sightseeing and tourism, and activate the economic pulse for the Chinese people, without increasing the total number of vacation days throughout the year, through the current flexible vacation adjustment and make-up work methods, in conjunction with the shift of holidays (please refer to the attached PDA file ""Holiday Shift Method Description""), so that there are ten days of holidays every year during the Spring Festival. 4. Based on the following points of view, it is suggested that it is most appropriate to move the 228th Peace Memorial Day: (1) Existing national holidays, except the Founding Day, 228th Peace Memorial Day, and National Day, are all folk festivals (Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival), and the Spring Festival falls in late January or February, which is close to the 228th Peace Memorial Day, so it is the most appropriate. (2) The 228th Peace Memorial Day flaunts peace, freedom, tolerance, and understanding. It is more meaningful to move this day, which flaunts peace, freedom, tolerance, and understanding, to the Spring Festival full of joy and hope. (3) In recent years, the 228th Peace Memorial Day has become a key point in the confrontation between the unification faction and the independence faction. It has formed a negative factor for social stability and the development of the country. It has been moved to the Spring Festival holiday and changed to only commemorate the day without a holiday. It can also demonstrate peace and freedom, reduce political conflicts, and create social harmony and tranquility. 5. Please refer to the attached PDA file for instructions on holiday transfer methods.', 'Cancel the flexible holidays and make-up shift days in the office calendar designated (scheduled) by the government every year_The advantages of canceling the flexible holidays and supplementary shift days in the office calendar designated (scheduled) by the government every year: 1. It can reduce the traffic flow during the national holidays. 2. If you make up work on Saturdays, there will be problems such as rest first and then make up. The government has the final say. 3. If you go to work on Saturday, there will also be problems that cannot be in line with international standards, such as the stock market...etc. 4. For industries that work according to the office calendar of government administrative agencies, when a national holiday falls on Tuesday or Thursday, they usually have a flexible holiday on that Monday or Friday, and make up work on the Saturday of the previous week to form a continuous holiday. But what about Labor Day Tuesday or Thursday? It will be automatically skipped. Another example is the Dragon Boat Festival in 106 years this year, which falls on Tuesday, May 30, so a flexible holiday will be implemented on Monday, May 29, and it will be changed to Saturday, June 3 to make up work. Originally, the make-up class was supposed to be on the previous Saturday, May 20th, but because May 20th this year coincided with the National High School Examination, the day of make-up work was changed to Saturday, June 3rd. That is to say, after a holiday, make up shifts. Therefore, for this year’s Dragon Boat Festival holiday, Monday, May 29 was originally a normal working day, and Saturday, June 3 was a rest day. After the swap, Monday, May 29 will be a rest day, and Saturday, June 3 will be a normal working day. Now the question is, if an employee is scheduled to leave on May 31, will they still be released on May 29? And if an employee reports on June 1, does he still need to go to work on Saturday, June 3? In this regard, the Ministry of Labor explained today that if the company is in principle on shifts one to five, but only changes this week, even new employees still have to follow the company\'s shift schedule, so the workers still have to go to work that day. According to the Ministry of Labor, workers going to work that day are still within the normal working hours and within the 40-hour working hours a week, so employers do not need to pay overtime pay or compensatory leave. The Ministry of Labor gave an example, just like employees who arrived on January 2, they cannot claim that the leave on January 1 was not taken, and they have to make up the leave. However, the Ministry of Labor also reminded that both employers and employees should make a clear statement before taking the job to avoid unnecessary labor disputes. 1060525 Citing Apple Daily’s August 4, 2013 report: The economy is depressed and the people are fighting for the economy. What should we do if we encounter flexible continuous holidays and business operations may be interrupted? Some manufacturers disagree with the government\'s flexible holiday measures. ""According to the practice of the Human Resources and Administration Office of the Executive Yuan, as long as the holiday is flexible, it may increase the troubles and costs of manufacturers. This approach is only beneficial to public agencies."" ""Depleting Taiwan\'s Competitiveness"" An optoelectronics manufacturer located in the Science Park gave an example. Taiwan has 115 holidays this year. However, the Spring Festival, Qingming Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival fall on Thursdays. Therefore, it has to flexibly adjust the holidays, and then make up classes and make up classes. The Taiwan government has always emphasized the need to be in line with the world. The executive of the company pointed out that unless natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes forced people to take vacations, this model of flexible vacation adjustments for the so-called convenience of the people is probably only found in Taiwan in the world. Not everyone who takes vacations can go to play, and they have to find a make-up shift on a Saturday, so the benefits of going to work are not good. Employees have no intention of making up shifts. It is understood that in order to facilitate flexible holidays, the Mondays (from Saturday to next Tuesday) or Fridays (from Thursday to Sunday) that are originally required to work must be taken together. Many corporate employees still have to go to work in order to cope with foreign orders and production business, especially many double-income families. On the other hand, the stock and foreign exchange markets have to ""make up"" transactions on Saturdays in order to cooperate with the make-up shift. However, the world\'s major stock and foreign exchange markets are closed that day, and overseas customers of enterprises are also on vacation. Xie Qijia, chairman of the Science Park Association, suggested that most companies in the park must cooperate with foreign customers. Most manufacturers are not happy to see such superficial holidays that conform to public opinion and take holidays for the sake of holidays. They hope that the government will not cause too much trouble for enterprises under the consideration of fighting the economy. The government responded to the opinions and appeals of the industry. Deputy Chief of Personnel Zhang Nianzhong only said that the current practice of flexible holidays has been discussed with relevant ministries, discussed with major industrial and commercial groups, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation. It has become a practice in recent years. When it comes to national holidays, if it falls on Tuesday or Thursday, the holiday can be flexibly adjusted. (Not on Labor Day).', ""Also leave autonomy to the people_Every year, when the Executive Yuan announces the calendar of the next year, there will always be a lot of noise around, questioning why the government can stipulate the day people should take the day off and must make up the day off on that day by just relying on administrative orders. The Executive Yuan announced on May 1, 2018 that there will be 115 days off in 2019, and the total number of days off will be the same as this (108) year. Among them, there are multiple consecutive holidays, including 7-day consecutive holidays for Spring Festival, 3-day consecutive holidays for February 28, 4-day consecutive holidays for Qingming Festival, 4-day consecutive holidays for Dragon Boat Festival, and 4-day consecutive holidays for Mid-Autumn Festival, etc. The Executive Yuan revealed a few days ago that starting in 2010, the Lunar New Year holiday will be extended to 7 days, starting from the Lunar New Year's Eve. Since the Lunar New Year's Eve in 109 falls on January 24, the Lunar New Year holiday will start on January 23 and last for 7 consecutive days. On the extra January 23rd, a day will be chosen to make up for work and school, and the number of holidays for the whole year is still 115 days, the same as this year. In addition, the Fridays of the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival will also have flexible holidays, turning them into 4-day consecutive holidays; and the 2 days of flexible holidays will also be selected to make up classes. It is called flexible adjustment of holidays, but in essence it restricts the freedom of the people. Personally, I cannot agree with such an outrageous practice. How can such a dignified democratic and free country be so domineering? Please join us and ask the promising government to stop this inappropriate practice.""]"

Legislation and amendments make ""national language"" no longer simply refer to Beiping Mandarin_Good night, ROC Public Policy Online Engagement Platform. The ""National Language Development Law"" was officially implemented on January 11, 2018, and it also represents the languages \u200b\u200bof all nationalities and ethnic groups in the Republic of China. They are both the official language of the Republic of China and the national language of the Republic of China. Beiping Mandarin (Mandarin) no longer has the status of the official language of the Republic of China and the national language of the Republic of China. Therefore, defining Beiping Mandarin (Chinese) as the national language is tantamount to conflicting with the ""National Language Development Law"", so legislation and amendments are required. The national language, national language, and national characters expressed by the central government agencies (institutions) of the Republic of China, government agencies (institutions) of cities and counties (cities) under the true jurisdiction of the Republic of China, and agencies (institutions) of the Republic of China in the mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign countries are amended to Chinese, Chinese, and Chinese characters. The official documents, publicity documents, and textbooks of the Republic of China, the national language, national language, and national characters, are amended to Chinese, Chinese, and Chinese characters. For example, the pronunciation of Mandarin is changed to Chinese, the course of Chinese is changed to Chinese, the history of the development of Chinese characters is changed to the history of Chinese characters, and so on. It is not recommended to use Chinese and Chinese characters, because the pronunciation of Chinese and Korean is too similar, and Chinese characters are already the common name for Chinese characters in the cultural circle of Chinese characters, so they are not called Chinese characters. However, some nouns can still use Han, for example, Guoxue was changed to Sinology.', 'Return my native language (Taiwanese, Hakka, Aboriginal language), the government should actively protect Taiwan\'s native language!_After the National Government moved to Taiwan, it implemented the Mandarin Movement and vigorously promoted Mandarin (Beijing dialect). People are required to use Chinese in public places, and schools are also prohibited from using their mother tongue, which has dealt a blow to Taiwan\'s original native languages \u200b\u200b(Taiwanese, Hakka, and aboriginal languages). Even if the national language campaign is no longer implemented after the lifting of martial law, the government starts to promote local languages, and primary schools have to teach mother tongue once a week, but it still cannot prevent the decline of Taiwan\'s native languages. Currently the most dominant and most popular Taiwanese language spoken by about 70% of the population, many of the younger generation can no longer converse fluently, and some even do not know it at all. If the Taiwanese language alone does not take root as soon as possible, some scholars predict that the Taiwanese language is very likely to disappear by the end of this century. Not to mention Hakka and Aboriginal languages? Language carries culture. If the native language disappears, Taiwan\'s native culture will face a huge loss. If the local culture disappears, it will be difficult for ordinary people to form a national identity for Taiwan. Therefore, the government should actively protect Taiwan\'s native language immediately. I suggest that the government take the following actions: 1. Promoting legislation to list Taiwanese, Hakka and all aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bas official languages \u200b\u200bso that the government has legal basis and is obliged to actively protect native languages. 2. When the heads of ministries and commissions at all levels of the government make public speeches, they should use their mother tongue as much as possible. 3. Encourage people to use their mother tongue in public. 4. Written official documents of major policies, in addition to Chinese, should also have versions in Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages \u200b\u200b(the use of Chinese characters or vernacular characters in written texts in Taiwanese and Hakka can be discussed further). 5. People have the right to use their mother tongue to communicate with government agencies, and the government should provide translators in a timely manner if necessary. (Refer to Fiji’s language policy) 6. All broadcasts on means of transportation (including airplanes, passenger transport, etc.) and public places (including department stores, hypermarkets, etc.) should have Taiwanese and Hakka versions, and they must be played in full, and the broadcast should not be interrupted due to lack of time. In places with a large population of indigenous peoples, there should also be broadcasts in indigenous languages. 7. In terms of education, the basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe national language curriculum outline of the Ministry of Education mentions ""the ability to correctly understand and flexibly use the native language"" at the beginning. However, among the native languages, the current school is completely dominated by Chinese, and there are almost no Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bthat are also native languages. In my opinion, the language education policy can refer to Hong Kong\'s current biliterate and trilingual policy. Currently, half of the Mandarin classes in schools at all levels can be taught in the mother tongue and half in the Chinese language, and other subjects should be taught in the mother tongue as much as possible. 8. The compulsory basic Chinese in universities should be replaced by the study or research of native culture and language, which will help ethnic groups blend and promote mutual understanding. All courses in the university can be taught in their native language according to the wishes of individual teachers. 9. The Ministry of Culture should immediately and completely stop subsidizing the filming of Chinese-language programs. 10. The Ministry of Culture should encourage TV stations to produce programs in Taiwanese, Hakka or aboriginal languages, and allocate subsidies to high-quality local language programs.', 'Amend the Language Equality Guarantee Law, add Vietnamese and Japanese in public places, and change traditional languages \u200b\u200binto the curriculum_1. At present, there are many Vietnamese migrant workers and their spouses in Taiwan. Many of them cannot understand Chinese and English. We should put Vietnamese on the radio and marquees in public places to help them live in Taiwan and adapt to Taiwan as soon as possible. 2. At present, there are many Japanese tourists who come to Taiwan to travel, but they cannot understand Chinese and English. We should put Japanese on the radio and marquee in public places, so that it is possible to increase the number of Japanese tourists to come to Taiwan. 3. In Taiwan, Chinese is our official language. Although not all Taiwanese can read and understand Chinese, they can understand Chinese, so there is no need to play Taiwanese and Hakka. If we really want to improve the traditional language skills of today’s young people, using public broadcasting is not a good way. I think education is the only way to really improve the level of traditional language, so that the traditional language will not be lost, and only Taiwanese and Hakka are played in public places, which is not fair to the aborigines. Why can Taiwanese and Hakka be released, but not the languages \u200b\u200bof the aboriginal people? There are some Aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bthat are really dying out. Therefore, I propose that Japanese and Vietnamese languages \u200b\u200bshould be added in public places so that resources can be provided to those who really need them, while Taiwanese and Hakka should be deleted, and traditional languages \u200b\u200b(including Hakka, Taiwanese and the traditional languages \u200b\u200bof various aboriginal peoples) should be included in formal education.']"

The imagination of marriage is also quite diverse. At the same time, the general public is constantly demanding that the restrictions on the rights and obligations of both parties in marriage be relaxed. And there are also success stories. For example: 1. my country\'s Interpretation Zi No. 748 has affirmed the right of same-sex marriage to exist. Now the Legislative Yuan has also enacted the ""Judicial Yuan Shizi No. 748 Interpretation and Implementation Law"". Marriage is no longer limited to heterosexual marriages, but same-sex marriages are also possible. 2. my country\'s Interpretation No. 791 has decriminalized adultery. Adultery in marriage is no longer punished by criminal law. The party claiming that its rights have been infringed can only request civil compensation from the other party for the contractual relationship. 3. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called ""Married Women Defend Their Rights"" has passed the second stage. The proposal advocates that women in a married relationship should be able to have an abortion of their own volition without the consent of the other party. Then the proposal was enthusiastically seconded, and there were many words of support on FB or the message area of \u200b\u200bthe proposal. It can be seen that the general public in today\'s society no longer thinks that the rights of spouses are the most important, and the rights of individual freedom and body rights are more important. 4. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called """"Affinity Law"": Prohibiting in-laws from interfering with both parties in a marriage with words, behaviors, and traditional customs, and implementing marriage autonomy and human rights within marriage"" has also been passed. The proposal advocates that any direct or collateral in-laws are prohibited from interfering with both parties in the marriage. The proposal has also been enthusiastically seconded. It can be seen that the general public now agrees that marriage is only a contract between the two parties. No one or in-laws has the right to intervene in this contract. That is, the marriage contract only exists between the parties. No one else has anything to do with the contract. 5. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called ""Opening up single women to legally implement ""artificial insemination"" and ""test-tube baby"""" has also passed the seconding stage. Although the proposal was responded to, it failed to amend the law. However, it also received enthusiastic seconding from this proposal. It can also be seen that today\'s society no longer thinks that only married people are suitable for bearing and raising children. Although the proposal has not yet passed the seconding stage, the proposal advocates that the consent of the spouse is not required for vasectomy. It is similar to the proposal of ""married women defending their own rights"". It also no longer believes that the rights of the spouse are the most important, and that the rights of individual liberty and body are more important. From the above cases and various proposals, the public in our country now agrees that marriage should be only a contractual relationship between the parties, and should not be restricted by too many rights and obligations. The public policy network participates in various proposals on the platform. At the same time, it avoids the need for the public to make frequent proposals and second proposals. This proposal advocates returning the civil law marriage contract to the essence of a simple contract. The more specific requirements are as follows: 1. The conclusion of marriage does not require the witness of a witness. As long as the parties decide on their own free will, the marriage contract can be concluded. 2. The dissolution of marriage does not require the consent of all parties. Freedom to dissolve the marriage contract. However, if one party claims that his rights are damaged, he can request civil compensation from the other party for the contract. 3. Marriage is a private contract, and the state should not interfere too much. If the parties agree, marriage should not be limited to two people, but as long as the parties agree, there is no limit to the number of people. 4. Based on the liberalism of the contract, the parties to the marriage should not be restricted by their status. However, based on eugenics, parties with specific blood relatives should not enter into marriage. Those under a certain age are also based on eugenics and children\'s rights. 5. Based on respect for private law contracts and the humility of punishment, bigamy should be decriminalized in the same way as adultery. The party claiming that its rights have been violated can only claim civil compensation from the other party for the contractual relationship. 6. The effectiveness of the marriage contract should be limited to the parties and has nothing to do with others. Therefore, the existence of legal affinity should be removed. The rights and obligations formed by the marriage relationship are only valid between the parties. 7. In order to respect the freedom and property rights of individuals, the legal property system between marriage parties should be changed to the provisions of the separate property system. If there is no special contract and registration between the parties, the property system should automatically apply the separate property system. 8. In order to respect the right to freedom of the individual, the parties to a marriage should not assume cohabitation obligations, support obligations, or act as agents for each other.']"

I hereby make a proposal, hoping that the Ministry of Education will suspend this announcement, and immediately hold a meeting of the team leaders of the national team group to discuss the possibility of taking into account the safety of the epidemic and the normal holding of the competition, so as to decide whether to suspend or continue the competition, and protect the rights and interests of all participating groups. Explanation: 1. Compatriots all over the country are concerned about the epidemic incident at Taoyuan Hospital in Taoyuan City, and they should also be vigilant and fight the epidemic together. There is no doubt about it. 2. Although the Ministry of Education claimed to have convened the organizer and 22 county and city representatives on 1/25, it did not hold a meeting of team leaders in advance, and did not invite any participating teams to express their opinions. This action hurt the rights and interests of students. The number of people is tens to hundreds of times that of the participating teams. Is there no doubt about the epidemic? 4. The number of people in each car of the railway, highway, and MRT, and the number of people in stores, restaurants, department stores, and national group tours. 5. This is the second year after the outbreak. In the first year, the Ministry of Education was caught off guard. Although it cannot be forgiven, it has nothing to do. This year is the second year. What is the backup plan for when the epidemic is not over in the plan of the Ministry of Education for the national team competition? The Ministry of Education should propose a better and more mature contingency plan after a year of forward planning based on the situation of the epidemic last year. It is obliged to fully explain to all the students, parents, and teachers who are diligently preparing for the competition. What is the effort of the Ministry of Education? We should not have the mentality of a gambler, and naively hope that the epidemic will go away in the short term. Could it be that under the epidemic, all student arts and cultural activities have to be suspended for a long time, and there is no countermeasure? Looking at many art and cultural performances that are still going on and there is no sign of stopping, there should be a good way to make the student art and cultural competition run smoothly. 6. Based on the above reasons, I hereby propose to ask the Ministry of Education to immediately suspend the decision to suspend the team competition, and hold a team leader meeting of the team competition as soon as possible to discuss the response plan as soon as possible.', 'The national student performing arts competition for the 2019 academic year and the team competition were suspended. Is there any other solution? (I know that someone has proposed, but please don\'t accept it yet)_At present, there is already a proposal with the same purpose on the website, and I hope to put forward a more complete idea here (More: I know that the Ministry of Education has stated in the Internet news that there will be no postponement, but I don’t want to spend three days of hard work and end up saving it on the computer↓) (In reply to the Ministry of Education, the news mentioned that the results of the team competition have little effect on the excess score, but in fact the competition score accounts for 12 points of the excess score, without which I may not be able to go to high school) In a classroom, it was not suspended. Why was the competition in the auditorium cancelled?) On 1/28, the Ministry of Education announced the cancellation of the team competition; the news that the competition was on schedule, but there is still more than a month before the competition date, is it too early to announce the cancellation now? After a year of baptism, the students\' concept of epidemic prevention can only be said to be more mature, and masks in public places are the basics. According to the current level of the epidemic, it is obviously not appropriate to directly announce the suspension before considering the postponement. However, the nearly 300,000 participants mentioned in the news had nothing to do with it. Most groups only stay around the arena for less than a day, and they are divided into multiple arenas (10). It is not 300,000 people crowded into one performance hall, it depends on the average number of people. Groups may come into contact with each other only when entering and exiting the arena. This can be completely avoided by moving line planning. Even now that the epidemic has broken out, all kinds of public transportation are still operating as usual, and I have never heard of crowds caused by taking the same bus/high-speed rail. What\'s more, everyone is from the same school, so they are more aware of their respective physical conditions, and there will be no unknown health status. Last year, as soon as I received the notice of the suspension of the national competition, it hit all the students who got the right to represent. After preparing for a whole year, but finally unable to show it on stage, all the results of hard practice were wiped out. At that time, when the epidemic just started, I can still understand. What cheered us up at that time was the hope that we could enter the final again next year, as well as the encouragement from our teachers. However, after another year of hard work by everyone, this year\'s team competition has been suspended again. So why are you practicing so hard? We are not trying to be rejected, and the current epidemic situation is ""not"" as serious as the same period last year. There is a better way besides suspending the event: Postponing the ""COVID-19 (New Coronary Pneumonia)"" Response Guidelines issued by the Epidemic Command Center: Public Gathering It is mentioned that for: 1. Non-essential, 2. Participating activities are not specific objects, 3. The form of activities has a high risk of infection due to intensive contact, it should be evaluated whether to postpone or suspend. Regardless of whether competitions are unnecessary; the participants must be students and teachers from various schools, and they are all specific targets. It can also be compared to the county competitions that do not accept observations, which is safer; as for intensive contact, everyone is usually in the same space for group training. Now it is just a different venue. From the perspective of whether it is necessary, last year\'s National Games was also postponed. Why did the sports competition go ahead, but the performing arts class was canceled? Although one is indoors and the other is outdoors, the performing arts class has less contact with other schools. Here are some suggestions for your reference: 1. Not open to spectators. 2. The organizer will issue photography certificates to those who have applied for it, or simply record the whole process by the organizer.', 'The national student performing arts competition for the 2019 academic year and the team competition were suspended. Is there any other solution? (I know that someone has proposed, but please don\'t accept it yet)_At present, there is already a proposal with the same purpose on the website, and I hope to put forward a more complete idea here (More: I know that the Ministry of Education has stated in the Internet news that it will not be postponed, but I don’t want to spend three days of hard work and only save it on the computer↓) National first place in Tainan 7; second place 6 points (full 10 points/100 points)] (Representing each school in the competition, the school will also reward students with merit and rewards, both of which are very important for further studies) (Candidates for the examination and academic test gathered in a classroom, and it was not suspended. Why was the competition in the auditorium cancelled?) On 1/28, the Ministry of Education announced the suspension of the team competition; After a year of baptism, the students\' concept of epidemic prevention can only be said to be more mature, and masks in public places are the basics. According to the current level of the epidemic, it is obviously not appropriate to directly announce the suspension before considering the postponement. However, the nearly 300,000 participants mentioned in the news had nothing to do with it. Most groups only stay around the arena for less than a day, and they are divided into multiple arenas (10). It is not 300,000 people crowded into one performance hall, it depends on the average number of people. Groups may come into contact with each other only when entering and exiting the arena. This can be completely avoided by moving line planning. Even now that the epidemic has broken out, all kinds of public transportation are still operating as usual, and I have never heard of crowds caused by taking the same bus/high-speed rail. What\'s more, everyone is from the same school, so they are more aware of their respective physical conditions, and there will be no unknown health status. Last year, as soon as I received the notice of the suspension of the national competition, it hit all the students who got the right to represent. After preparing for a whole year, but finally unable to show it on stage, all the results of hard practice were wiped out. At that time, when the epidemic just started, I can still understand. What cheered us up at that time was the hope that we could enter the final again next year, as well as the encouragement from our teachers. However, after another year of hard work by everyone, this year\'s team competition has been suspended again. So why are you practicing so hard? We are not working hard to be rejected, and the current epidemic situation is ""not"" as serious as the same period last year. There is a better way besides suspending the operation: . Postponement The ""COVID-19 (New Coronary Pneumonia)"" response guidelines issued by the Epidemic Command Center: Public gatherings mentioned that for: 1. Non-essential, 2. Participation activities are not specific objects, 3. The form of activities has a high risk of infection due to intensive contact, it should be evaluated whether to postpone or cancel. Regardless of whether competitions are unnecessary; the participants must be students and teachers from various schools, and they are all specific targets. It can also be compared to the county competitions that do not accept observations, which is safer; as for intensive contact, everyone is usually in the same space for group training. Now it is just a different venue. From the perspective of whether it is necessary, last year\'s National Games was also postponed. Why did the sports competition go ahead, but the performing arts class was canceled? Although one is indoors and the other is outdoors, the performing arts class has less contact with other schools. Here are some suggestions for your reference: 1. Not open to spectators. 2. The organizer will issue photography certificates to those who have applied for it, or simply record the whole process by the organizer.']"

We hope that this platform will take necessary actions for this inappropriate behavior.', 'Proposal to abolish the Online Engagement Platform for Public Policy_The National Development Council launched the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"" on February 10, 2015. It has been more than two and a half years since its establishment. The ""Suggestions"" function was also launched on September 10, 2015. The purpose is to hope that the public can use this platform to promote national participation in public policy. Since its inception, there have been about 2,600 proposals, but only about 100 cases have been completed. Moreover, after the completion of the case, there may not be the result that the proposer wanted. It is an online platform that wastes social resources. Many people judge a public policy based on their subjective ideology, personal preferences, and values, and they often think that what should be done is the right way to do it. However, public policy is not at all the opinion of a few people who can represent more than 23 million people in Taiwan. This is very subjective. What\'s more, even if the case is completed, it may not get a positive response, and the proposals that can really solve the problem are quite limited. Instead of wasting resources on such meaningless proposals that can solve the problem through ordinary petition channels, it is more practical to spend the tax money paid by these people on things like smart transportation, labor rights, and health insurance. Therefore, it is proposed to abolish the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"".', 'The ""Public Policy Network Participation Platform"" should really abide by the ""Public Policy Network Participation Implementation Points""_There are only three regulations on the same or similar proposals in the ""Key Points for Online Participation in Public Policy"" (point 5, paragraph 2, item 1, point 6, paragraph 3, and point 8, paragraph 2), and the platform management agency is not authorized to reject similar proposals because the same or similar proposals already exist on the platform. Another proposal I made a few days ago, ""Change the proposal review mechanism of the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"" to a formal review"", was reviewed by the reviewer with ""I have already given a lecture to add ""Do you have any suggestions or opinions on the revision of the ""Public Policy Online Participation Implementation Key Points""? Welcome everyone to give a lecture! It failed to enter the seconding procedure on the grounds of ""problem"", which has violated the ""Public Policy Network Participation Implementation Key Points"". However, even if there are repeated proposals, it should follow the third paragraph of the sixth point, ""after contacting and confirming with the proposer"" before ""replying to the participating platform management agency with specific reasons, or the proposer decides to withdraw the proposal or amend the content of the proposal."" Instead of simply rejecting it. What\'s more, the ""public lecture"" system is the ""policy consultation"" after the third chapter of the implementation points, and the third paragraph of the sixth point does not apply to my proposal at all. In my proposal, the National Development Council serves as both the ""platform management authority"" and the proposed ""authority authority"". Please reviewers understand the difference between these two identities. In the ""verification"" stage, as a ""platform management agency"", the formal review of the proposal can only be carried out in accordance with the implementation points. Proposals that do not violate the implementation points can only be allowed to enter the seconding procedure. As for how to deal with the proposed case (such as the second paragraph of point 8) as a ""authority and responsibility organ"" after the secondment is passed, that is after the secondment is passed.']"

The disaster prevention and warning system mainly utilizes wireless mobile phone broadcasting technology to instantly and widely push and broadcast warning messages to mobile phone users within the coverage of base stations in areas designated by domestic telecommunications operators. The ""Earthquake Early Warning"" issued by the ""Disaster Prevention and Warning System"" is a service of the Meteorological Bureau\'s ""Strong Earthquake Instant Warning"" (the Japan Meteorological Agency calls it ""Emergency Earthquake Early Warning""). The bureau receives high-quality real-time seismic signals from various localities 24 hours a day. When a medium-to-large-scale earthquake occurs in Taiwan or near the coast, the system will automatically use the first few seconds of P-wave data received by a few seismic stations near the epicentre to perform real-time calculations and quickly obtain the epicenter information of the earthquake, including the time of occurrence, epicentral location, depth and scale. Combined with empirical formulas and local site effects, the estimated seismic intensity and estimated arrival time of S waves in areas far from the epicentre can be provided to facilitate emergency response to strong earthquake disaster reduction. Our country should follow the example of the National Seismic Intensity Rapid Reporting and Early Warning Project of the China Earthquake Administration, which adopts a mixture of on-site (in-situ) early-warning models and remote early-warning models, which can be more time-sensitive than the original regional type.', 'TV channel ""Earthquake Quick Report"" broadcasting function for real-time overlay broadcast function Unified warning sound Added voice prompts, added shock wave countdown during overlay_Because Taiwan is located at the junction of the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate, it is part of the circum-Pacific seismic belt, so seismic activity is very frequent. The recent Hualien earthquake has caused serious disasters in Hualien area and aroused the public\'s awareness of the earthquake crisis. It is still impossible to predict the occurrence of earthquakes with today\'s capabilities. Therefore, the golden evacuation time is very important from the time of the earthquake to the end of the shaking. Even if you are far away from the epicenter, there is an early evacuation time. Therefore, it is very important and necessary for the public to receive earthquake information immediately. At present, some news channel media in Taiwan have cooperated with the Central Meteorological Bureau to broadcast the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" message. ""Earthquake Quick Report"" can present the earthquake information on the TV screen as soon as the earthquake occurs, allowing viewers to receive first-hand earthquake information. However, the inconsistency of the warning sound has caused troubles to the public. If the warning sound of this function can be unified and voice prompts can be added, it will be easier for the public to recognize the earthquake information, and the reciprocal of the arrival time of the seismic wave will be added during the instant cover period to expand the density and breadth of information transmission.', 'Because Taiwan is located at the junction of the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate, it is part of the circum-Pacific seismic belt, so seismic activity is very frequent.

Although mobile phones have the function of real-time push and broadcast earthquake warnings, there are still problems such as the lack of support of mobile phone equipment and signal problems, resulting in the failure of mobile phones to receive earthquake information. According to Nielsen\'s 2015 Media Survey, Taiwanese people watch an average of 162 minutes of TV a day. Although it is less than the time spent on the Internet, it is still the second most exposed to media. Therefore, it is necessary to add the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" function to all TV channels. At present, some news channel media in Taiwan have cooperated with the Central Meteorological Bureau to broadcast the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" message. ""Earthquake Quick Report"" can present the earthquake information on the TV screen as soon as the earthquake occurs, allowing viewers to receive first-hand earthquake information. If this function can be extended to all TV channels, it will be easier for the public to receive earthquake information and expand the density and breadth of information transmission. (Schematic video/Dongsen News, Central Meteorological Bureau simulation screen) The main added function From the first time the earthquake occurs to a few seconds after the end, the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" message will be broadcast on the screen cover, including the approximate time of the earthquake, its intensity and the warning area. The ""Earthquake Quick Report"" message is broadcast on a striking color background, and the size and location of the broadcast must be easily readable by the audience. When the ""Earthquake Express"" message is broadcast, the warning sound is played simultaneously, and the volume is higher than the volume of the channel program or advertisement. After the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" ended, an earthquake warning message was broadcast on the side of the screen for a few minutes to remind the public to beware of aftershocks. When the scale of the earthquake and the affected area are relatively large, information cards such as earthquake notices can be broadcast after the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" to remind the public of correct disaster prevention knowledge. Standardize and unify the broadcasting conditions of ""Earthquake Quick Report"", including seismic intensity and whether it is a regional earthquake, etc. Unify the screen ratio and duration of the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" broadcast. Standardize the broadcasting conditions of earthquake information cards. Solution Through laws and regulations to regulate the media of each channel to add the broadcast function of ""Earthquake Quick Report"" cover station. TVB broadcasts ""Earthquake Quick Report"" by itself; cable TV channels are broadcasted by the cable TV operator (system) in a unified way. In addition, news channels have a lot of information displayed on the screen at the same time to prevent news information from being covered up, so they do not broadcast on news stations. Other possible ways are welcome to discuss. The above is a relatively unprofessional proposal. If there is any mistake, corrections and suggestions are welcome._Dynasty']"
