And in an era when personal information laws are becoming more and more important, personal privacy is very important. For example, when you apply for a job by publishing information on the website, you often receive phone calls and letters from companies that do not want to apply for the project, which means that the entire personal information is disclosed to online banks. Complete gender equality work rights are required, unless the recruitment of talents or specific jobs, the general company (catering, service, finance) must have a gender ratio of at least 1/3~2/3. As a large job bank, you should set a good example. Most companies in Taiwan do not disclose the information, but they require job applicants to disclose all of them. Based on the principle of fairness, the company must indeed disclose the address, person in charge, phone number, working hours, actual days of vacation, calculation of overtime pay, and basic calculation of salary. If it is not provided correctly or not provided, it should not be allowed to be listed or applied for. The content of online talent recruitment has legal effect. Only the company that issued the interview invitation letter and the employee confirms that he agrees to the interview can see the phone call. There shall be no gender distinction in any work. The company must clearly disclose the address, person in charge, telephone number, working hours, actual days of vacation, calculation of overtime pay, basic calculation of salary, annual leave, etc. Must keep up with new laws.

The company's application materials are downloaded for reference and have legal effect. If there are differences in actual work, the employees can raise and claim for compensation. Employees must be provided with labor health insurance from the first day of work, and companies that do not provide employees with labor health insurance shall be appropriately punished. It is simplified for employees to report and provide evidence, and the company will increase the punishment for repeat offenders in the future.

Before 2010, Taiwan has always had a customary tradition of ""study study leave"". Schools adjust their schedules within 3 to 4 days of the section exam, and most of them leave school at noon or 2.3 o\'clock, so that students can use their own time. 2. June 2010: The Ministry of Education invited all counties and cities to hold a meeting in June to reach a consensus. The ""study study leave"" is a long-term ""convention"" but there is no clear regulation. Based on considerations such as normal teaching, the safety of students, and the inconvenience of parents taking care of them, the Ministry of Education decided that it is not appropriate to leave school early for regular assessment days in senior high schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools across the country. Yang Changyu, director of the State Education Department of the Ministry of Education, said that in the past, ""study leave"" was given. Because many parents did not go to get off work, some students could only be sent to nursing classes, or went to the street to have fun. There have been cases of carnival accidents after exams. 3. Official document supporting evidence: Letter from the Ministry of Education Date of issue: April 27, 2010 Document number: Taiguo (1) Zi No. 1000051598 Subject: Relevant Your association has explained to the Ministry of Education that it is possible to arrange study leave on the day of the regular evaluation of primary and secondary schools. 4. I am a current high school teacher. I have been in the field of education for many years. The wrong decision of the Ministry of Education is the reason why the self-study time for the national high school entrance examination accounts for almost half of the sessions. There are about 10 compulsory exams in junior high schools, which are spread over 3 to 4 days to reduce the pressure on students to take the exams. However, the current policy is to treat the school as a parenting class. Is it dangerous to drop the exams early? Isn\'t it dangerous to go back to school to clean up? Winter and summer vacations are not dangerous? 5. In the past, the Ministry of Education invited various counties and cities to hold meetings, issued official documents, and even the Director of State Education released a statement. Now, your review agency has repeatedly blocked the proposal to restore the leave of review, using the excuse that the Ministry of Education did not mandate that it is an independent matter for each school. Could it be that I forged the official document? Could it be that I pretended to be the head of state education? Your inspection agency completely ignores the fact that the Ministry of Education has real influence, and has repeatedly failed to pass the review of the proposal to restore fake academic records. May I ask you whether you have a ghost or a guilty conscience? Sixth, the person who tied the bell must be untied. If the official document issued by the Ministry of Education in the past stated that there was no mandatory provision to cancel the study leave, then please ask them to withdraw this sentence in the official document again: ""Schools should be dismissed early after the regular assessment.""']"
1,0,356,0_railway_rail_station_highspeed,"['railway', 'rail', 'station', 'highspeed', 'pingtung', 'line', 'trains', 'airport', 'kaohsiung', 'train']","['The government should promote the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung StationOrigin: In 1987, the comprehensive plan for undergrounding the Kaohsiung Railway (Kaohsiung Project) included the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station. However, in 1994, the Kaohsiung Project was split into an implementation plan (undergrounding the railway) and a follow-up plan (extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station). The extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station has been put on hold until now. In the counties and cities that the high-speed rail passes through, the stations are named after the names of the counties and cities, except for the high-speed rail Nangang Station, Banqiao Station, and Zuoying Station. The former two are named after the district name because they belong to the Greater Taipei area and already have Taipei Station. This is also the reason why the high-speed rail Zuoying Station is not called Kaohsiung Station, so that the high-speed rail can be extended to Kaohsiung Station. The new Kaohsiung Station has reserved space for the high-speed rail, but according to the ""Preliminary Report on the Engineering and Technology of the High-speed Rail Extension Pingtung Route Plan"", the reserved space for the high-speed rail has been changed and handed over to Taiwan Railway for commercial use. This means that the government is considering abandoning the extension of the high-speed rail to Kaohsiung Station? Appeal: The government should re-evaluate whether the high-speed rail is extended to Kaohsiung Station. New route plan. Among them, Plan 1 and Plan 2 will set up a station for the high-speed rail at Kaohsiung Station. Option 1 is technically infeasible and can be discarded directly. Plan 2 and Plan 3, according to the author\'s personal suggestion, Plan 2 is better than Plan 3. Option 2 is technically feasible. The current Taiwan Railway temporary rail construction can be used for the tunnel of the high-speed rail passing through the Kaohsiung City section. Although limited by the existing curve radius of the Gushan section of the Taiwan Railway, it cannot travel at high speeds. However, the high-speed rail also has two major bends in Taipei, namely Mengka Avenue and North Gate, which also cannot travel at high speed, so this is not a problem. The bigger problem is that the construction of the Green Park Road along the line, the construction of the circular light rail Gushan Station-Museum Station, and the national highway transfer station, bus transfer station, and ceiling above Kaohsiung Station must be postponed, but the author believes that a delay of several years should be within the acceptable range of Kaohsiung citizens. The problem with option 3 is that there will always be problems no matter where it exits from. The branch from Yanchao will seriously affect the operation of Tainan-Zuoying Station during the construction period. After completion, it will cause inconvenience for commuting between Kaohsiung and Pingtung. If it is diverted from Zuoying, there will be the problem of back-facing seats. To avoid back-facing seats, passengers can only change trains at Zuoying Station. The Zuoying-Pingtung section is equivalent to a branch line, which will cause inconvenience for passengers from the north of Tainan to travel to and from Pingtung, and is not conducive to the great blueprint for the direct operation of the high-speed rail around the island in the future. The government’s top priority when constructing transportation construction is how to bring the greatest convenience to passengers? How to bring the greatest benefits? Instead of focusing on the required funds, it is better to build whichever is cheaper. Now that one chance has been missed, the only last chance left must be seized. Because this cannot be delayed, and it cannot be said to wait 5 years or 10 years before evaluating. At present, the second phase of the ring-shaped light rail has started construction. The section between Gushan Station and the Art Museum station will be opened to traffic in August this year before entering the construction site. However, the light rail corridor is planned to be on the corridor reserved for the high-speed rail tunnel. If it is determined that the high-speed rail will extend to Kaohsiung Station, the light rail project between Gushan Station and Art Museum Station can be postponed until the high-speed rail tunnel is completed (the missing section in the middle of the circular light rail can be temporarily connected by bus or Taiwan Railway), or the design can be changed so that it does not occupy the reserved corridor of the high-speed rail tunnel. And the construction of the ground and ceiling of Kaohsiung Station will be postponed first, and the high-speed rail platform and connecting switch will be built first to facilitate the follow-up projects and reduce the delay time for the opening of the new Kaohsiung Station. It is hoped that the government can carefully evaluate and make a decision that is most beneficial to the interests of all the people as soon as possible.', 'The high-speed rail extension ""Zuoying plan"" was changed to ""Kaohsiung plan"", and whether to extend Taitung from Pingbei again!There are currently many people opposing the ""Zuoying Branch Line Plan""! At the same time, many people are waiting for the high-speed rail to enter Kaohsiung Station, and they don\'t want to let the plan that was promised fall through! The ""Xiaogang Chaozhou Case"" only uses elevated roads to pass through the urban area. The long route and the demolition of many buildings lead to excessive expenses, and have a great impact on other traffic and buildings in Kaohsiung! It is hoped that the high-speed rail will first be extended to downtown Kaohsiung and Pingtung, and after setting up co-constructed stations at three TRA stations in the urban area, it will then be extended from Pingbei to Taitung, in the same way as the northern extension to Yilan! Introduction: The extension of high-speed rail is expected by everyone, but the best results can only be achieved by choosing the right policy. If only the previous Zuoying bifurcation scheme is used, the high-speed rail will have to turn back at Zuoying to go to Pingtung. The travel time is not much different from that of the Taiwan Railway direct train, and if it is installed in Liukuaicuo, it will not be convenient to transfer to the destination of most passengers; if the extension of Xiaogang is used, it will have a great impact on many traffic and buildings in Kaohsiung City. After the Pingtung Station became three-dimensional, the space on the north side has been idle for a long time. If the space on the north side is used to build a high-speed rail station, which will be co-constructed with the Taiwan Railway Pingtung Station, you can go directly to the train station or transfer center to take Taiwan Railway, buses, taxis and road passenger transportation. In addition, if the high-speed rail uses the Yanchao branch to be elevated across the entire line, it will once again regain the world\'s longest bridge, and it will also reduce the impact of the high-speed rail entering Kaohsiung City on the local area! The cost of building high-speed rail in the eastern region is huge, and it may also have excessive adverse effects on the environment. If the high-speed rail is built from Taipei, it will be too difficult to enter Taitung via Yilan and Hualien. After traveling from downtown Kaohsiung to downtown Pingtung, it passes through Changzhi, Wutai, and Beinan to build a tunnel to reach Taitung City and set up a high-speed rail station. Compared with the Taiwan Railway Pingtung Line + South Link Line, it is more than 60 kilometers shorter, saving more than 1 hour! It also makes it easier for Taichung, Taoyuan and other western regions to travel back and forth to Taitung, and it is convenient for people in Taitung to go to the urban area for medical treatment immediately, so as to prevent more patients from missing the emergency time again and again! Plan content: Due to the large number of people commuting between Kaohsiung City and Pingtung City, the high-speed rail will be extended from Zuoying first, and high-speed rail stations will be set up at Kaohsiung Station and Pingtung Station. If the high-speed rail is extended to Kaohsiung Station first, a single-hole double-track tunnel can be built along the Kama Road space on the east side of the railway, as the line for the high-speed rail to enter Kaohsiung Station, reducing the impact on Taiwan Railway and light rail projects; from Kaohsiung Station to Pingtung, use the underground and elevated section of the existing railway north side of the surface railway space to build high-speed rail tunnels and bridges to Pingtung Station, and use the open space on the north side of Pingtung Station to build the high-speed rail station. After the opening of Pingtung Station, it will extend to Taitung. Pass through the Changzhi Road section and follow the high-speed rail line built around Taiwan Line 24 to enter Wutai, then cross the mountains through Beinan through the Zhongdao Tunnel, and then enter Taitung City along Zhongxing Road, and set up the high-speed rail Taitung Station at Taiwan Railway Taitung Station.', 'The high-speed rail extension ""Zuoying plan"" was changed to ""Kaohsiung plan"", and the extension from Pingbei to Taitung was evaluated; the construction of the east-west expressway in Gaoping and the double-tracking of the southern circuit were postponed!There are currently many people opposing the ""Zuoying Branch Line Plan""!

Introduction: At present, by car or other means of driving, from Kaohsiung City to Pingtung City, you can take National Highway No. 1 and turn to National Highway 10 or Taiwan Highway 88 to go east-west. When you are near Pingtung, turn to National Highway No. 3 and go north-south to enter Pingtung City. This saves you the time of driving on county roads and township roads. In addition, the population and traffic flow of Renwu and Jiuru, which were originally planned to be connected, are relatively small, and they are some distance from the urban area, so the benefits after construction may not be great. The extension of the high-speed rail is expected by everyone, but the best results can only be achieved by choosing the right policy.

2,1,243,1_animal_dogs_animals_stray,"['animal', 'dogs', 'animals', 'stray', 'cats', 'pets', 'pet', 'protection', 'dog', 'breeding']","['Completely repeal the Animal Protection Act and any related animal welfare policiesThe reasons for completely abolishing the Animal Protection Law are as follows: 1. The Animal Protection Law is full of contradictions and loopholes. For example: Article 6 of the Animal Protection Law stipulates that no animal shall be abused or harmed, but Article 12 does not restrict the slaughter of commercial animals and experimental animals. The slaughter process will definitely harm the animals themselves, so the two contradict each other. 2. The Animal Protection Law only gives special treatment to certain types of animals. The overall law only protects dogs, cats and other vertebrates that are raised or managed by humans. Other animals of the same level such as chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. can be slaughtered at will, and the law defines the category of ""economic animals"". Purpose to use or slaughter? Therefore, in terms of fairness, the so-called ""dogs, cats"" and other animals should also be listed as economic animals in order to comply with the equal treatment of all vertebrates. 3. Animals are not human beings and should not be protected by law. The purpose of the law is to adapt to the changes and developments of human society, that is, the law aims to regulate the maintenance and protection of human life, and the law emphasizes the justice, equality and objectivity of human society. The protection of animals is neither in line with social justice, nor is it for the purpose of protecting or regulating human life. 4. The animal protection law is not in line with the overall fairness. Many people think that ""abuse or even slaughter of pets such as cats and dogs"" is a very strange thing that should not be done, but don\'t forget that this is simply our inexplicable doting on pets. If pets should not be abused or even slaughtered, then chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and even other molluscs, arthropods (insects), or non-animal bacteria and viruses should also enjoy the same rights. After all, they are also ""life"" and should be respected. Why do people only prefer to protect them? What about animals that should be protected while ignoring the protection of other animals? This does not seem to be in line with overall fairness. Conclusion: My personal opinion is that the ""Animal Protection Law"" should be completely abolished, and the law as a whole is completely inconsistent with equality and the law is too subjective. Dogs, cats and other ""pets"" for human entertainment and companions enjoy more noble protection than other animals. Are economic animals and experimental animals not ""life"" and should not have the same protection? Besides, what is the so-called ""pet""? Animals raised or kept for entertainment or companionship? This is simply a preference and arrogance for a particular animal! And the law also specifically emphasizes ""dog"" and ""cat""... It\'s a subjective idea at all! Therefore, the Animal Protection Law should be abolished. Besides, animals should not have the same rights as humans. The whole law is simply spoiling pets and animals from a subjective point of view, and this law does not help human society at all!', 'Cats and dogs across the country (including commercially bred and traded dogs and cats, stray dogs and cats, pet dogs and cats, and imported dogs and cats) are all subject to pet registration, and owners found to be violating regulations will be punished without persuasion.1. At present, not all counties and cities implement TNVR for stray cats and dogs. The TNVR for external stray cats and dogs should be enforced across Taiwan to reduce the proliferation of external stray cats and dogs. Incorporating TNVR into policies and decrees can be implemented more quickly. However, all stray dogs and cats are registered as pets, which can force local governments to manage stray dogs and cats, control the population, and speed up the TNVR sterilization work. 2. The current regulations only require microchip implantation for commercial dogs and cats in breeding farms and trading businesses. Chips are only numbers and do not represent identity marking, and source management cannot be implemented. Commercial cats and dogs in breeding farms and trading businesses should be forced to register pets from birth (the concept of household registration), so that local government animal protection agencies can actually control the source, implement management of breeding farms and trading businesses, completely eradicate legal protection and illegality, and handle change registration according to the flow (traceable concept). 3. For cats and dogs imported from abroad, although microchips and rabies vaccinations have been mandatory, domestic laws clearly stipulate that dogs and cats should be registered and sterilized as pets. Once they enter the country, they must comply with domestic laws. The customs will have veterinary quarantine officers who should complete the pet registration and neutering of dogs and cats after entering the country (the importer or owner should pay the fee to the customs) before they are released for the owner to take back for effective control. 4. Amendment to Article 22 of the Animal Protection Law does not stipulate that the owner is not required to use birth control. As long as the owner is a dog, cats and dogs should be fertilized to prevent private births. 5. The law stipulates that commercial dogs and cats are inspected only once a year. There are no inspection regulations for pet dogs and cats, and source management cannot be implemented. The Council of Agriculture should announce the number of dogs and cats in counties and cities across the country every year, and use special laws that go beyond local system laws to control personnel. One animal protection inspector is assigned to every 1,000 dogs and cats. Cats should be treated once a year. After the management is implemented, the number of animal protection workers will be reduced year by year. 7. To improve the environment of public and private shelters, set standards (including medical equipment) and staffing of administration, management, and veterinary staff according to legal regulations. In addition, large-scale enterprises are encouraged to set up public welfare private animal shelters in the form of tax reduction and exemption, so as to improve the quality of shelter and the plight of insufficient resources in existing private shelters. 8. Pet registration should be linked with household registration management. When the owner’s household registration changes, pet registration should be changed simultaneously, and household registration management should note the registration information of household dogs, cats and pets. Although the current pet registration is mandatory, there are still provisions for persuasion and improvement. The persuasion should be cancelled. If a dog or cat that has not been registered is found, the owner can be directly punished, and the current minimum fine of 3,000 yuan and a maximum of 15,000 yuan will be raised to a minimum of 15,000 yuan and a maximum fine of 75,000 yuan.', 'Adopt stray animals, subsidize neutering and a free animal health checkBackground Reasons Taiwan\'s ""Zero Euthanasia for Stray Animals"" policy came into effect on February 4, 2017, and officially hit the road on February 6. Since then, all public animal shelters in Taiwan have banned the culling of dogs and cats. Although it is regarded as a major progress in Taiwan\'s animal protection movement, the adoption of such a policy lacks corresponding supporting measures, and may even bring greater harm and impact to animals. Because of zero euthanasia, people feel at ease in abandoning and raising animals, and no longer worry about whether they will be punished by God for doing so, so the number of stray animals will increase even more than before. Therefore, in order to reduce the density of animals in the shelters, the local government adopted the principle of ""precise capture"", that is, stray dogs can only be captured unless they have attacked or injured the facts and have been confirmed by the informant. The excessive reproduction of stray animals, coupled with the overcrowding of animal shelters, the accumulation of too many stray animals, the environment is dirty and unsightly, and the animals live in an uncomfortable way, which easily leads to the occurrence and infection of diseases. Proposal content After adopting a stray animal in a public shelter, the identity of the stray animal will be marked on the microchip of the pet. Pets with stray animal status, after being confirmed, can be neutered free of charge at the animal hospital, and have the opportunity to have a free animal health examination. Anyone who abandons the adopted animals at will will be verified based on the microchip and the pet owner will be fined.']"

Implement the spirit of returning prices to the public, fairness, and housing justice. 2. High-frequency transactions of short-term housing transactions, renting houses, increasing the tax rate, earmarking funds for special purposes, expanding investment in social housing construction, subsidizing the weak and maintenance. 3. Disconnect the rent of social housing from the market price, lease according to the standard and spirit of the announced land price, rather than the market price, and levy land value tax for investors/speculators, and tax based on the announced land price, especially for the disadvantaged and ordinary people. 4. Under the guise of returning to the market mechanism, investors are allowed to speculate, causing people to be unable to rent houses, and housing prices have risen to the point that people cannot afford them. This is the government\'s inaction and dereliction of duty. Residential justice is the responsibility of the government, not procrastination and grace. 5. Stop deceiving yourself by saying that real estate is a locomotive industry. There is not a single advanced country in the world that has developed through real estate speculation by the whole people. China\'s lessons and lessons learned from the past are right in front of us. 6. The construction of government public works is the construction invested by the people\'s tax money, and the results of regional development driven by it should be shared by the whole people, not as a tool for consortium builders to hype. Proposal content: 1. For the same natural person, their spouse, and minor children, who hold more than 2 ""self-use houses"" at the same time, and the holding period of the third or more households (including the third household) is within the following range, when considering the purchase, there will be renovation and related fees, so 100% taxation will not be imposed. Note 1: The house changer should not be considered, the house should not be held as an investment commodity, and the house change should not be used as an arbitrage. If the house changer is really self-occupied, he will not have the psychology of speculative arbitrage and expect to profit from it. Note 2: Purchases by non-natural persons should still be handled in the same way. Those who sell within 1-5 years are subject to 80% difference tax. Those who sell within 6-10 years are subject to 50% difference tax. Those who sell within 10-20 years are subject to 25% difference tax. Price tax must be registered and taxed at the real price at the time of purchase and sale. It is no longer levied at the announced land price, and the more households there are, the higher the tax rate, and the progressive tax rate is adopted. Note: The purchase by non-natural persons still needs to be handled by reference. If it is used as an internal staff dormitory, a certificate needs to be provided. If it violates the rules, it needs to be paid and fined. 3. If the same natural person, his/her spouse, and minor children hold more than 2 ""self-use residences"" at the same time, after the second household, banks are not allowed to undertake house purchase loans, and can only lend with credit loans. For each additional household, the loan interest rate adopts a progressive tax rate. 4. Restrict investment institutions, finance, and insurance companies from purchasing ""houses for self-use"" for investment purposes. 5. The above-mentioned income should be invested in the construction of social housing. At the same time, it should not be based on ""comparing with the rental market in the vicinity"", which will cause the rent of social housing to be unaffordable even for the weak. 6. Increase the scale of social housing, reduce the rent of social housing year by year in the future, and reduce the incentives and motivations for self-purchasing houses. At the same time, the unreasonable regulations that the rent of social housing will be increased year by year and the rent must be moved out after the expiration of the period will be cancelled.', ""Levy land hoard house tax to achieve average land rightsPurpose: The general direction is to control land prices. Individuals or legal persons should be controlled to hold a large number of land houses (houses basically include land), and hoard them to wait for the rise. Method: It is necessary to adjust the holding tax (land value tax, housing tax). It is better to sell than to collect rent or to increase the population share. Amendments: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on Equal Land Rights, local tax rates remain unchanged for self-occupiers, and multiplied for non-self-occupiers to bridge the gap between market prices and announced land prices. Additions: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on the Equalization of Land Titles, National Tax Collection, and tax bases will accumulate the total amount of tax bases reported by each locality, and set grades, thereby controlling the amount of land holdings. Personal concept formula: the owner's total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Conceptual formula of legal person: the owner’s total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Items that can be deducted (turnover, business tax, employee salaries, etc.) depend on how much tax this piece of land helps the government generate, or how many families it takes care of; then the individual case provides upstream and downstream relationships for review. Explanation: Is the country's construction land really not enough? The reason for the imbalance between the supply and demand of landed houses is that the cost of holding landed houses is very low. We all know that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone knows that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone thinks that they can only buy and not sell. 1. Don’t plan for light holding tax of 3% and 5%. Of course, light tax is like boiling a frog in warm water. What I want is 5 times and 10 times the tax amount to bridge the gap between the market price and the announced land price. 2. Definition of house hoarding: The owner of the house has not registered, even if the house is vacant, it is also hoarding the house, and the unoccupied house tax must be paid. Charitable rental is an evil law set up to make these people hoard houses. One day it will not be a charity, so it is not called hoarding during this period? It is better for the government to impose heavy taxes to subsidize renters. Significantly increase the tax on non-self-occupied houses, and levy national taxes to subsidize disadvantaged renters according to the national overall progressive method. 3. Definition of hoarding land: Regardless of whether it is rezoning or buying and inheriting vacant land for construction, regardless of whether there are roads or parking lots and gas stations, etc., it cannot be used as land tax. As long as it is land for construction, it must pay land value tax. Setting up a parking lot seems to be very public welfare. When it turns back to the construction site one day, isn’t it called land hoarding during this period? Why not build a city plan to reward three-dimensional parking towers, or set up public parking lots when the land is rezoned. Substantially increase the land price tax for non-owner-occupied people, and levy national taxes to supplement military expenditures to defend the country in accordance with the overall progressive method throughout the country. 4. Returning prices to the public: The government takes care of the landlords in every possible way. Land rezoning changes, agricultural land has been converted into industrial land. Landlords don’t even think about how long they have broken the law. 5. Legal use: Industrial land is used to build houses, agricultural land is used to build factories, illegal use of land should be reported immediately and demolished, including industrial houses where collective housing has become a company share, air-raid shelter compartment rental, etc. are illegal. 6. The problem of land lease: The land should be used to build houses for people to live in, instead of using iron sheets to collect rent and continue hoarding the land. It is obviously residential land but it does not help housing at all. Land cannot be imported, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. 7. The problem of house rental: I live in a relatively small house and have enough room to rent others to collect rent. I shouldn’t buy more and more land and continue to collect rent. Do these people look at the rent of 2% or 3% in that year? Of course they look at the increase of 20% to 30% in the year. 8. Fish and meat rent collection: A large number of rent collectors who hold land and housing are equivalent to fish and meat villagers. Rent collection cannot create employment. 9. Reasonable rent collection: For example, the government plans to pay 30 per person, but I only use 20, or I only use 10 when I am wronged, and I have no objection to using the rest for rent collection. 10. Reasonable rent: the monthly rent for residential needs, it is stipulated that the total rental income of the leased object shall not be greater than the leased object (current value of the announced land + assessed current value of the house)/360; 360 months are calculated based on the building’s use for 30 years. 11. The government is required to set a date for the sunrise of land hoarding tax as soon as possible, so that financial real estate and other related industries can start to respond."", 'A house is hard to find, a slave for lifeIn Taiwan in 2020, under a social system where everything goes up but wages don’t, under the choice of the dream of buying a house for young people or even middle-aged people, it is no longer an era where you want to work hard to buy a house, but simply unable to repay the housing prices that often start at tens of millions. If you think, I’ll just buy a second-hand house. In fact, housing investors have their sights on the second-hand house market. It’s also the time when banks start low-interest loans. You can’t buy second-hand houses as you want, and they are often bought by investors. They rent out a second child and let others pay the loan for themselves. However, new construction companies often use verbal words to convince you that there are not many houses left as soon as the sale starts, in order to speculate on housing prices, but in fact there are a lot of empty houses. The above is just a dictation. In fact, the current policies: such as real estate transaction registration, vacant house tax, house hoarding tax, and increasing the tax rate for purchasing multiple houses, are all advocated. It is suggested to curb the vacancy rate and the endless price rise in the legislative stage. 1. Taxation: For ""real estate tax"", ""transaction tax"", ""spread tax"" (sales and transactions price difference), ""rent personal income tax"", four parts are listed, formulated by the central government, and the tax collected is distributed to local governments. B. For the sale of new houses, builders are required to honestly disclose the selling price, make the transaction transparent, reduce sales disputes, and achieve the principle of fairness and justice in the transaction. C. The seller must be forced to enter the actual price of the house price transaction in order to obtain the authorization letter to protect the buyer\'s right to purchase the house. D. The reasonable price of the new house should be proposed by the builder based on the three aspects of land cost, building material cost, and labor cost. 3. Penal measures: A. When the house price exceeds 50% of the applied reasonable price, the penalty should be xxx and the person in charge of the seller should face a prison term without a fine. B. Those who cannot afford to buy a house will be fined and imprisoned without a fine, and those who log in to buy a house with their heads will be given a heavier sentence. ..................................................

However, there are still many immature things in it, such as: independent learning time, three extra periods of independent learning in high school, the Ministry of Education hopes that students will use this time to explore interests, research and learn in places they are interested in, but such as the first session last year, the second session this year, and the third session next year. Parent-Child World, September 2020 Issue / Issue 114: Independent Learning—A Survey of Key Abilities in the Era of Curriculum 108), students may play mobile phones at this time and do things that are not in line with what the Ministry of Education originally expected students to do. I hope that the Ministry of Education can re-examine the way the independent learning time is carried out, or arrange interest exploration courses for students during this time, so that students can better understand their own ambitions and interests, and then achieve the original intention of the independent learning time. Repeated/missing courses, students of last year, this year, and next year, because the old syllabus is linking up with the new syllabus, so in some courses, they will learn knowledge that they have learned before or have not learned at all. Teachers may not know that students have not learned it in junior high school and make supplements. I hope that the Ministry of Education can make more careful planning in this regard, and do not use the form of ""bridge-up courses"" to force students to take extra classes during summer vacation, or to stay for an extra eighth period. The Ministry of Education has asked schools to plan the compulsory compulsory courses for each school according to their characteristics and prospects. However, middle school students (advanced high schools) do not know that high schools have such different courses for each school. Therefore, students may not consider this factor in their choice of high school. In this way, high school students may find that they do not really like the compulsory courses of their own school, but are more interested in the compulsory courses of other schools. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can strengthen the publicity of each school\'s distinctive compulsory courses for junior high school students. Schools do not necessarily have a specialized and professional curriculum planning system like the Ministry of Education for the revision of compulsory content. Therefore, the revision of compulsory courses may be too difficult for students, or even meaningless to implement. I hope that the Ministry of Education can restrict the revision of compulsory courses and set the direction for schools to avoid the output of courses that are too difficult for students, and make the revision of compulsory courses more valuable. Learning history archives, I think the Ministry of Education’s learning history archives are good intentions, they can record students’ learning achievements in the three years of high school, and also provide a good reference for university admission applications, but I hope the Ministry of Education can consider whether the learning history archives may lose its authenticity? Is there any possibility of fraud? Or is it an arms race for parents? It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can better plan the implementation of the learning process file, so that it has greater reference significance and value. Most students, parents, and even teachers do not have a thorough understanding of the 108 syllabus. I hope the Ministry of Education can educate students and parents more. Based on the above points, I hope the Ministry of Education can better plan and adjust the 108 syllabus for high schools.']"

Because the cost of plastic bags set by various companies is a drop in the bucket for most consumers, it has no significant effect on reducing the willingness to use them. And the current policy set by the government requires most stores not to provide free plastic bags, the purpose of which is to reduce the use of plastic. Because the cost of plastic bags set by various companies is a drop in the bucket for most consumers, it has no significant effect on reducing the willingness to use them. Moreover, even though the price of plastic bags is already extremely low, compared to the low manufacturing cost, it is still easy to profit from merchants, let alone achieve the effect of plastic reduction. If the plastic tax is levied in a way similar to the ancient tax on tobacco skin (such as: cigarette donation), the purpose of reducing plastic can be achieved by focusing on activities such as environmental protection education. Example: The United Kingdom has adopted plastic bag charges since 2015 (about 5 pence a piece, about NT$5) to help reduce litter, protect wildlife and hopefully influence consumer behaviour. The policy has managed to reduce the number of billions of plastic bags and prevent plastic bags from ending up in the ocean and polluting the environment. The current plastic bag fee charge applies to retailers employing more than 250 people. This measure has contributed to a 95% drop in plastic bag sales in major UK supermarkets. The UK has also announced that starting from April 2021, the scope of plastic bag charges will be extended to all retailers, and the cost of plastic bags will increase from 5 pence to 10 pence (about NT$10) to further protect the ocean from plastic waste pollution.', 'Levy a plastic tax to make the environment better togetherThe government has set a policy requiring most stores not to provide free plastic bags. The purpose is to reduce the use of plastic bags by the public. Because the cost of plastic bags set by various companies is mostly a drop in the bucket for consumers, it has no significant effect on reducing the willingness to use. Moreover, there is a gap between the income and cost of plastic bags, which will lead to the situation of profit-seeking businesses. If the cash flow is concentrated on environmental protection education and other activities, the goal of plastic reduction actions can be achieved. Specific matters: collection of tax on plastic bags (EX: increase the purchase of a plastic bag to more than 10 yuan (inclusive) or the government overcharges the manufacturing tax or raw material tax of plastic bags), or reduce external costs by means of Pigou tax (EX: cigarette donation... how much money is pumped for each plastic bag, etc.) Method: reduce people’s willingness (demand) to use plastic bags through price control Billion single-use plastic bags are used. And from 2020, the asking price of each plastic shopping bag will increase to 10p', 'Expand the scope of plastic restriction policy(1) Proposed content (current situation): 1. 1991 plastic restriction policy: the scope of the plastic restriction policy promoted by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1991 only included: public departments, public and private schools, department stores and shopping centers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, chain convenience stores, and chain fast food restaurants. 2. 106-year plastic restriction policy: The plastic restriction policy established in 2016 has added 7 categories of control objects, including drugstores/beauty stores/pharmacies, medical equipment stores, home appliance photography/information/communication equipment retail, book and stationery retail, laundry, beverage stores, pastry bakeries, etc. It is stipulated that thick and thin bags made of various plastic materials (PE, PP, PS, PVC, raw plastics, decomposable plastics, etc.) The payment amount for plastic bags will still be determined by the operators themselves. 3. Plastic straw restriction policy in July 2018: In the plastic restriction policy that will be implemented on July 1 this year, it is stipulated that government departments, schools, department stores, shopping centers, fast food chains and other four types of places are not allowed to provide disposable plastic straws for ""internal use"". Originally, straws coated and laminated with plastic film with a plastic content of less than 10% by weight were also allowed to be banned, but straws such as bagasse, paper, and biodegradable plastics were allowed as alternatives. (2) Suggestions (future) 1. The current plastic restriction policy has not been extended to night markets, vegetable markets and food stalls. However, most of our livelihood consumption is here. For example, when buying vegetables in the vegetable market, most consumers are used to packing different types of vegetables in different plastic bags, plus meat and seafood must be bagged separately, and finally put vegetables and meat in large plastic bags. In this way, the number of plastic bags that each consumer needs is very surprising. 2. Therefore, we believe that the plastic restriction policy should be extended to night markets, vegetable markets, and food stalls. Only then will the use of plastic bags be truly reduced, and the plastic restriction policy will not become empty talk. The government also needs to encourage the private sector to sell a variety of reusable bags and other products that can replace plastic bags. Schools should also set up relevant environmental protection courses, so that our next generation will have the concept of caring for the earth from an early age, and can also put the concept into practice. 3. In terms of policy implementation, we believe that in addition to expanding the scope of plastic restrictions, the purchase price of plastic bags should also be increased, so as to deter the public. We will give rewards to stores that obey the policy obediently, and we will give penalties to stores that do not comply with the policy. And use the whistle-blowing system, that is, after the government has finished publicizing, it is not enough to just rely on the police to issue bills for unruly stores. People should be encouraged to report and rewarded.']"

There is no cure for severe pneumonia in Wuhan. Also quite serious. 1.2. Although the chances of life-threatening patients with mild symptoms are much lower, according to the current information, they are still quite contagious. * That is to say: It is likely that many Chinese people do not know that they are sick, and the symptoms are not serious, so they are walking around outside. Not to mention those mentally retarded people who obviously have a fever, but insist on taking antipyretics and run around to play, and don't take other people's lives seriously. 2. Rapid spread 2.1. At present, there are cases all over the world. Almost all patients are from Wuhan, China, and most of them have never been to the seafood market. It can be seen that the current information on the source of the infection is likely to be incorrect, or the cluster of human-to-human transmission occurred far earlier than China's official announcement. 2.2. First declare that I cannot verify this information. All the hospitals in Wuhan are full of beds, and a certain unit instructs all new suspected patients to be given flu medicines, and then asked them to return home for isolation. This is equivalent to not doing any epidemic control. 2.3. Again, I cannot verify this information. The six crematoriums in Wuhan are running at full speed, which is unprecedented. 3. Concealing the epidemic situation 3.1. If [the number of overseas cases/number of passengers on a flight in Wuhan]*the total population base of Wuhan, the number of infected people is at least 5,000. Most international experts estimate that there are currently more than 5,000 to 10,000 Chinese infected with Wuhan pneumonia, and the result of a simulation run by a supercomputer in a standing member country shows that the number of patients is several times the above number, and it is believed that it is still contagious before fever. * 3.2. Wuhan has a population of tens of millions. If there are more than 500 cases of infection and 17 deaths, will the whole of Wuhan need to be sealed off during the Spring Festival? 3.3. Similarly, if the situation is really not serious, why even Huanggang next to Wuhan with a population of 7 million and Echeng with a population of 1 million should be closed during the Spring Festival? 4. Conclusions: 4.1. Please ask the government to immediately ban all flights from China from entering Taiwan. Yes, no matter whether they are Taiwanese businessmen, Chinese, or foreigners flying from China, all of them are not allowed to enter Taiwan, so as to ensure the safety of Taiwan's epidemic prevention. 4.2. Please ask the government to immediately send all Wuhan tourists, even Chinese tourists, who are still in Taiwan, back to China.

It is useless to make fun of the safety of the public and our country\'s determination to prevent the epidemic. So far in March, since the government has announced that all non-Chinese nationals are restricted from entering the country, tens of thousands of people have returned to Taiwan one after another. If any of these people do not cooperate, the possible breach of epidemic prevention must be borne by the whole people... Therefore, it is proposed that in the current ""Special Regulations on the Prevention and Relief of Severe Specific Infectious Pneumonia and Relief and Revitalization"", those suffering from Wuhan pneumonia or suspected patients who do not follow the instructions and risk of infecting others can be sentenced to a maximum of 2 years in prison or a fine of 2 million yuan. And those who have been quarantined or quarantined by the competent health authorities at all levels, if they leave the quarantine place without permission, they will be fined 200,000 to 1 million yuan; those under quarantine who violate the quarantine measures and leave the quarantine place without authorization will be fined 100,000 to 1 million yuan. The penalties are adjusted as follows: 1. Those suffering from Wuhan pneumonia or suspected patients who do not follow the instructions and have the risk of infecting others can be sentenced to a maximum of 15 to 20 years in prison or a fine of 20 million yuan. 2. If you leave the quarantine place without authorization, you will be fined 2 million to 10 million yuan; if you violate the quarantine measures and leave the quarantine place without authorization, you will be fined 1 million to 10 million yuan.

Explanation: Tai-88 has been open to run large-scale heavy-duty locomotives for many years, but large-scale heavy-duty locomotives can only drive to Fengshan Interchange at most, and there is still a long distance from Zhongzheng Interchange, which is closer to the city center. It is not convenient enough for commuters and tourists, and it will take more time. Moreover, the Fengshan Interchange is often congested, and the buffer zone is very short. Large vehicles and small vehicles are lined up along the shoulder of the road every day. For riders who are not familiar with this place, it is very likely to enter by mistake (missing the interchange by accident), or even more dangerous, they may be forced into the traffic flow. It may be a better choice to extend the exit to Sanduo/Zhongzheng Interchange. National Highway No. 10 is a good example and demonstration. From Cuihua Intersection, you can take the viaduct to the high-speed rail station and connect to Dazhong Road. Although you can't drive the national highway completely, it still increases the convenience. East to West direction: If large heavy locomotives can drive along the outermost side to the Zhongzheng Interchange or the Sanduo Exit and go down, it will save a lot of time for crossing the urban area. From west to east: Go up from Zhongzheng Interchange and follow the outermost line to connect to Taiwan Line 88. The exit of Yinruilong Road is to extend to the right and get off the expressway. Large and heavy locomotives only need to stay in the same lane. Currently, there are only 88 vehicles in the southern region that can drive large heavy locomotives. Even so, the existing road planning can still improve efficiency and convenience, reduce the time spent in the urban area, and increase the willingness of downtown riders to travel to Pingtung.

There are too many cars getting off the interchange, which makes some drivers unwilling to line up. They often illegally intervene when approaching the interchange, causing the illegal vehicles to slow down, and the speed of the rear vehicles is forced to slow down. Even because of inserting a vehicle or changing lanes, cause a traffic accident. The Tokyo-Osaka expressway has two lines going south or going north. As a result, the expressway has no congestion problem at the interchange. The main reason is that a few kilometers before the interchange, the two lines become three lines. Drivers who want to get off the interchange must enter the third line in advance, because there will be a stone pier between the third line and the second line. Therefore, it is recommended that there be a line dedicated to the vehicles when getting off the interchange. The length should be as long as 5 kilometers, and it should be separated by stone piers 3 to 4 kilometers in advance. In this way, choose an interchange for trial use. It is best to warn drivers 7 kilometers in advance that they must drive into the special lane of the interchange, otherwise they will not be able to get off the interchange.

If the employer requires workers to work overtime, it needs to be agreed by the workers, and it should not exceed five hours, including 30 minutes for meals and a ten-minute break for every hour and a half of overtime. The total working hours of a working day shall not exceed fourteen hours. Working hours beyond the basic working hours of nine hours are considered overtime, and the employer must pay twice the basic salary. 2. The upper limit of working hours on rest days is 11 hours, including a 40-minute meal break and a 10-minute break for every two hours of work. The salary is calculated based on overtime hours, and the salary for the whole day needs to be paid twice the basic salary. 3. Holidays are free time for workers, and employers cannot require workers to go to work. Unless it is a related industry with special attendance. 4. Workers are required to rest for more than nine consecutive hours in each work cycle. That is to say, a work cycle is from the end of the day to the start of the next day. 2. Supporting measures for special working hours or special attendance Because the nature and working hours of certain industries will affect the general public, workers need to attend work on holidays or the nature of work will affect the special attendance and special working hours of the general public. 1. Special attendance: In response to the needs of the employer's industry and the convenience of the public, workers need to attend work on holidays. Employers may require employees to attend work on holidays and designate working and rest periods. The upper limit of working hours is eleven hours, including a thirty-minute meal break and a ten-minute break every two hours of work. The four major industries are public transportation, service industry, catering industry, and entertainment industry. Other industries need to provide relevant industry information to the local government and obtain the consent of the local government and the company's trade union and labor to belong to this clause. The employer also needs to give the workers a day off in the working days of the week. The full-day salary is calculated at 1.5 times the basic salary. In addition, the employer must reach a consensus with the company's trade union representatives or workers on the working hours and rest periods proposed by the employer before requiring employees to attend work. 2. Special working hours: In response to the needs of the management and the convenience of the public, the working hours of the workers are special. The management can formulate the working hours and rest periods of the working day according to the needs of the management, and the working hours and rest periods of the working day proposed by the management can only be implemented after reaching a consensus with the company's trade union representatives and workers. The employer must follow the 14-hour working period as the upper limit, including 70 minutes for two meals and a 10-minute break for every two hours of work, plus more than ten consecutive hours of rest in each working cycle, to formulate the working period and rest period of the working day. The special working hours are based on eight hours as the basic working hours, and the working hours exceeding eight hours are counted as overtime hours. The employer shall pay twice the basic salary. 3. Agreement on working hours 1. In response to differences in various industries. The basic principle is that the clock-in and commute hours are the working hours of the workers. Meal time and rest time are considered working hours. If it is not possible to clock in and go to and from get off work to determine the working hours, the management needs to agree with the company's trade union representatives and laborers on the method of determining the working hours to and from work. Working hours are required for meal breaks and breaks. 2. In response to the scale of each industry, special working hours and special attendance on working days need to be approved by the company's trade union representatives and half of the company's workers; if there is no trade union, more than two-thirds of the company's workers must agree to implement it. 4. Popularization of Labor Inspection and Punishment 1. Increase local labor inspectors, take the initiative to implement regional labor inspections on a daily basis, and safeguard the rights of workers. 2. Local governments set up mailboxes and hotlines for reporting labor violations. 3. Those who have been seized by the labor inspection or verified by the report. The manager of the company shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than one month but not more than six months, and shall be fined NT$100,000 without any fine. The company needs to improve within a period of one week. If there is no improvement, it can continue to punish and increase the prison sentence of its managers. Companies that have been punished more than three times in a row are ordered to suspend operations until they improve."", 'The calculation of overtime for compensatory leave should be done in the same way as the double calculation of overtime pay, such as multiplying by 1.33/1.66/2 times, rather than 1:1 conversion[Two proposals] 1. The calculation method of compensatory leave for overtime work should be handled in the same way as the calculation method of doubling overtime pay, such as multiplying by 1.33/1.66/2 times instead of 1:1 conversion. 2. The employer cannot limit the time limit for compensatory leave, otherwise the wages for extended working hours shall be arrested according to law. [Explanation] According to Article 24 of the current Labor Standards Law, only those employers who regulate the extension of labor hours, the wages for the extension of working hours shall be paid according to the standard (listed below). However, in order to save costs, employers often require workers to exchange compensatory leave instead of overtime pay, and even compensatory leave can only be exchanged at a rate of 1:1 (overtime work on holidays can only be exchanged for one day of compensatory leave on weekdays), which is completely unfair to workers. In addition, most employers will limit the use period of labor compensatory leave: for example, it must be used up within two months. Workers ""eat"" compensatory leave before they have used it up, and are not paid overtime pay in accordance with the law. However, in practice, if they want to ask for compensatory leave, they may be made things difficult by various factors or threatened with performance appraisals. The above-mentioned phenomenon has led to the laborers working hard overtime, but in the end they have nothing. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor should face up to this problem. I urge you to start amending the law as soon as possible, just like the amendment of a case, requiring that even if the labor and management agree to use compensatory leave in exchange for compensation for extended working hours, it should be handled in accordance with Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act and the multiplier calculation standard of related laws and regulations. For example: if you work overtime on holidays, the overtime pay is double, so the compensatory leave should be two days. (Currently only one day) Two hours before overtime work on weekdays, the catch repair should be multiplied by 1.33 to calculate, and from the third hour onwards, multiplied by 1.66 to calculate. Guo Fangyu, the former Minister of Labor, also said in the Legislative Yuan that it is unfair to replace overtime pay with compensatory leave and will review it in the near future. However, with the change of ministers, there is no change in overtime pay in proportion to compensatory leave. Please ask the Ministry of Labor to face up to this problem. Workers cannot be allowed to do meritorious deeds forever, but their hard work will not be worth compensatory rest. [Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act] 1. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than one-third of their daily hourly wages. 2. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than two-thirds of their daily hourly wages. 3. In accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 3, those who extend their working hours shall be paid double the daily hourly wages. If the employer makes the laborer work on the day of rest stipulated in Article 36, and the working time is less than two hours, the wage shall be paid an additional one and one-third of the normal hourly wage; if the worker continues to work after working for two hours, an additional one and two-thirds of the normal hourly wage shall be paid. For the calculation of the working hours and wages of the rest day mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if it is less than four hours, it shall be counted as four hours; if it exceeds four hours to less than eight hours, it shall be counted as eight hours; if it exceeds eight hours to less than twelve hours, it shall be counted as twelve hours.', 'The government should not take the lead in exploiting labor, civil servants should be paid overtime pay according to the actual number of approved overtime hours, abolish compensatory leave and administrative reward systemArticle 24 of the Labor Standards Act stipulates that if an employer extends the working hours of a worker, overtime pay shall be paid at the rate of one-third to one-and-two-thirds of the normal hourly wage. The government, as the employer of public sector workers (civil servants and state-owned enterprises), not only does not pay overtime pay, but even overtime hours exceeding 20 hours can only be given administrative rewards such as compensatory leave or rewards. Junior-level supervisors adopt a responsibility system and are not allowed to receive any overtime pay. They can only choose compensatory leave or rewards. Therefore, it is suggested that the government should strictly control the overtime work of civil servants in advance, and pay overtime pay according to the actual hours for the overtime work approved and assigned, and stop taking the lead in exploiting labor. Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act. If the employer extends the working hours of the laborer, the wages for the extended working hours shall be increased according to the following standards: 1. If the extended working hours are less than two hours, an additional one-third of the normal hourly wages shall be paid. 2. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than two-thirds of their daily hourly wages. 3. In accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 3, those who extend their working hours shall be paid double the daily hourly wages. If the employer makes the laborer work on the day of rest stipulated in Article 36, and the working time is less than two hours, the wage shall be paid an additional one and one-third of the normal hourly wage; if the worker continues to work after working for two hours, an additional one and two-thirds of the normal hourly wage shall be paid. For the calculation of the working hours and wages of the rest day mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if it is less than four hours, it shall be counted as four hours; if it exceeds four hours to less than eight hours, it shall be counted as eight hours; if it exceeds eight hours to less than twelve hours, it shall be counted as twelve hours. Main points of overtime payment for each agency (abbreviated) 2. Payment standard: Calculated in the following way per hour: (1) Employees: non-supervisors are paid monthly salaries and professional bonuses. Supervisors and junior (assigned) non-supervisors are paid according to their supervisory positions. For those who have a record, plus supervisory positions or the sum of the three items of supervisory compensation. Divided by 240 is the hourly payment standard. 3. Employees of various agencies who have been assigned to work overtime in accordance with regulations may encourage employees to choose to take make-up leave within six months after working overtime, and the unit is hourly, without additional overtime pay. 5. Overtime control regulations for staff of various agencies (including hired personnel by contract): (1) Overtime work by staff of various agencies (including hired personnel by contract) shall be assigned by the supervisor of the unit after verification and assignment according to business needs. Each person shall work overtime no more than four hours per day and twenty hours per month. (3) Overtime work shall not be paid to those who work overtime except for the various personnel listed in the proviso of the preceding paragraph, but may choose supplementary leave or rewards according to the fact of overtime work and regulations.']"

The government keeps saying that we want a non-nuclear homeland and that nuclear energy should be replaced by green energy. However, various alternatives are either too late (the evaluation of various power generation methods takes time), or they are expensive (solar power generation equipment is expensive and have a short service life), or they are unrealistic (tidal power generation, ocean current power generation, or use love to generate electricity?), or they are serious pollution (coal-fired thermal power generation is the fastest way to make up for the current power shortage, but the whole world, including mainland China, is working hard to reduce this highly polluting power generation method. Taiwan has turned back and set Taiwan’s environmental protection back for 30 years, why don’t we simply burn wood to generate electricity?) Seeing that the peak of electricity consumption in summer is approaching, there is still no better way to solve the urgent need. The promise of abolishing the fourth nuclear power plant and establishing a non-nuclear homeland seems to remain unchanged, but the price is to restart the second nuclear power plant and restart the high-pollution coal-fired thermal power plant that has been shut down for more than 10 years. But isn't Nuclear Two nuclear energy? Is Core 2 any cleaner? Is nuclear 2 safer than nuclear 4? Is Core 2 newer than Core 4? Will restarting Core 2 be cheaper than launching a new Core 4? Please ask the government to think of some reasons that can convince the people of the country, and tell the people why the nuclear plant that spent 300 to 400 billion people's hard-earned money to build is not used. Instead of abolishing it, it restarts the old nuclear plant that has been in operation for 3 to 40 years. What is the reason for this? Even if it is impossible to abolish the nuclear power for a while, if it is necessary to use it as an emergency, it should be used to activate the new one and destroy the old one, right?

Related reports can be found in Link 3. 4. In countries such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Singapore, the complete vaccination rate has exceeded 80%, but the number of infected people and severe cases has not decreased but increased, indicating that large-scale complete vaccination cannot achieve the effect of herd immunity.

Discussion on the problem of the left-turn lane on the current road useThere are many left-turn lanes on the road, some diverge from the inner lane, and some are the entire inner lane. If the left-turn lane is the entire inner lane, it is likely to cause traffic chaos, because straight-going vehicles and right-turning vehicles can only drive in the outer lane, and locomotives often pass in the slow lane and the slow lane, and if the car goes straight from the fast lane, it will be fined between NT$600 and NT$1,800 in accordance with Article 48 of the ""Road Traffic Management Penalty Regulations"" (Global Law Database, 2022). Ask this question for improvement. In order to achieve this goal, the county and city governments need to implement the following: 1. Re-plan the left-turn lane: remove the inner lane that was originally set as a left-turn lane, and change it to a new left-turn lane that extends from the inner lane to the opposite inner lane. 2. Add road signs: When the traffic volume is heavy, the ground signs are often blocked by other cars, and it is impossible to judge whether it is a dedicated lane. If the special lane is marked on the side of the road and an upright stop sign is set up, the accident rate in the area and the probability of the driver getting a ticket can be effectively reduced. 3. Increased guidance in driving training classes: If you want to improve road safety, you must first improve from the root cause. The driving training class must emphasize the road significance of the left-turn lane and the locations where accidents often occur, and teach passers-by the traffic regulations that should be observed when passing the left-turn lane. 4. Changing the seconds of traffic lights: The green lights of most arterial roads are longer than those of secondary roads, but in some cases, the traffic flow of secondary roads is much higher than that of main roads, so we think that the number of seconds for red and green lights should be set according to the amount of traffic at the intersection at that time. The combination of traffic light seconds at each intersection is not the same, and if the traffic light seconds at each intersection cooperate well with each other, vehicles can be effectively unblocked.', ""Addition of turning lanes for automobiles and motorcycles and prohibition of turning left on the insideUnder the current traffic system, cars can turn left directly without special left-turn lights. However, direct left turns of automobiles and motorcycles will cause cars to cross too much oncoming straight traffic, resulting in car accidents. They drive to the inside and turn left. Because they need to stop and wait for the oncoming straight, not only will the inner high-speed vehicles fail to brake, but also cause congestion due to the simultaneous convergence of straight-going and left-turning vehicles in the inner lane. The actual driving is similar to the current left-turn lane for motorcycles, but an additional lane needs to be opened to accommodate left-turn left-turn motorcycles, and the signs and directions are redesigned, and special turn signals and left-turn turn lights are added. It is also forbidden for any vehicle to turn left directly in the inner lane or turn without following the turn signal. It is also necessary to add a left-turn lane to the driver's license test."", 'Cancel the mandatory two-stage left turn for locomotives and remove the forbidden locomotive lane.

I believe everyone has two wheels and four wheels.

I don\'t know. Motorcycles keep to the right is the fate of a narrow escape. Examples of dangers on the far right. 1. Bus stops 2.

It will cut off the driving direction of the locomotive, and at the same time, it will cause traffic jams in the rear. If the locomotives in the third lane want to go straight, they have to worry about whether there will be cars in the second lane turning right directly.

A public policy online participation platform has been established. Through the proposals proposed by the public, we can see issues that have not been noticed or heard, and through the number of seconders, we can clearly see the public opinion. However, since some teachers discovered this platform, in order to make students care more about public affairs, some teachers asked students to submit proposals as homework within a time limit, and the number of seconders was used as the basis for assignment grading. Some students put forward their own ideas and opinions here, and many people agreed. However, some people are just looking for issues that have never been proposed for the purpose of handing in homework, and canvassing votes in other ways in order to improve their grades. This interferes with the original function of the public policy online participation platform to integrate public opinion and promote social discussion. Proposals do not necessarily reflect needs to the government, and seconding does not necessarily mean expressing approval of proposals. Students' homework conceals the direction of public opinion. Therefore, it is hoped that teachers will be prohibited from allowing students to use public policy online participation platforms as proposal assignments and the number of seconders as the basis for grading."", 'Proposal to abolish the Online Engagement Platform for Public PolicyThe National Development Council launched the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"" on February 10, 2015. It has been more than two and a half years since its establishment. The ""Suggestions"" function was also launched on September 10, 2015. The purpose is to hope that the public can use this platform to promote national participation in public policy. Since its inception, there have been about 2,600 proposals, but only about 100 cases have been completed. Moreover, after the completion of the case, there may not be the result that the proposer wanted. It is an online platform that wastes social resources. Many people judge a public policy based on their subjective ideology, personal preferences, and values, and they often think that what should be done is the right way to do it. However, public policy is not at all the opinion of a few people who can represent more than 23 million people in Taiwan. This is very subjective. What\'s more, even if the case is completed, it may not get a positive response, and the proposals that can really solve the problem are quite limited. Instead of wasting resources on such meaningless proposals that can solve the problem through ordinary petition channels, it is more practical to spend the tax money paid by these people on things like smart transportation, labor rights, and health insurance. Therefore, it is proposed to abolish the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"".', 'The ""Public Policy Network Participation Platform"" should really abide by the ""Public Policy Network Participation Implementation Points""There are only three regulations on the same or similar proposals in the ""Key Points for Online Participation in Public Policy"" (point 5, paragraph 2, item 1, point 6, paragraph 3, and point 8, paragraph 2), and the platform management agency is not authorized to reject similar proposals because the same or similar proposals already exist on the platform. Another proposal I made a few days ago, ""Change the proposal review mechanism of the ""Public Policy Online Participation Platform"" to a formal review"", was reviewed by the reviewer with ""I have already given a lecture to add ""Do you have any suggestions or opinions on the revision of the ""Public Policy Online Participation Implementation Key Points""? Welcome everyone to give a lecture! It failed to enter the seconding procedure on the grounds of ""problem"", which has violated the ""Public Policy Network Participation Implementation Key Points"". However, even if there are repeated proposals, it should follow the third paragraph of the sixth point, ""after contacting and confirming with the proposer"" before ""replying to the participating platform management agency with specific reasons, or the proposer decides to withdraw the proposal or amend the content of the proposal."" Instead of simply rejecting it. What\'s more, the ""public lecture"" system is the ""policy consultation"" after the third chapter of the implementation points, and the third paragraph of the sixth point does not apply to my proposal at all. In my proposal, the National Development Council serves as both the ""platform management authority"" and the proposed ""authority authority"". Please reviewers understand the difference between these two identities. In the ""verification"" stage, as a ""platform management agency"", the formal review of the proposal can only be carried out in accordance with the implementation points. Proposals that do not violate the implementation points can only be allowed to enter the seconding procedure. As for how to deal with the proposed case (such as the second paragraph of point 8) as a ""authority and responsibility organ"" after the secondment is passed, that is after the secondment is passed.']"
16,15,86,15_education_university_students_universities,"['education', 'university', 'students', 'universities', 'school', 'filial', 'piety', 'learning', 'high', 'schools']","['Increase the weight of technical practical tests in college entrance examinations, correct misunderstandings about technical skills and improve quality and quantityIn Taiwan, many college graduates also face the relationship between general universities that are too superfluous, resulting in a decline in the value of college diplomas, and fewer and fewer people are involved in the technical and vocational education system, causing the country\'s industrial and commercial talents to face a gap. Investigating the reasons, in addition to the problems of the college entrance system, the higher vocational education system also has many problems. We believe that we should guide general universities to transform into universities of science and technology. Students who are currently enrolled in the technical vocational system are often regarded as having unsatisfactory grades in Taiwan, so many students are unwilling to enroll. However, in order to achieve the adaptive development of each student, instead of requiring students to study the subjects of ordinary high schools and enter ordinary universities, it is better to transform general university counseling into universities of science and technology, so that the overall number of general students entering universities will be reduced, and students who are more suitable for practice will be guided to higher vocational and technological universities. In this part, Taiwan may learn from the German education system. Teachers and parents provide individual case guidance to students, divert students from high schools in China, and enter ordinary high schools or vocational systems according to students\' abilities and aptitudes. In terms of the entrance system, although there are professional subject examinations for higher vocational colleges to enter universities of science and technology, they are still in the form of multiple choice questions, and only some design groups have practical tests. How can multiple-choice questions test students’ practical ability? Even if some HKUST universities have practical practice in the second stage, if they fail to pass the previous paper-and-pencil test, it will be futile, and technical students will lose the advantage of having professional skills. The new exams that will be implemented in the next 111 academic year seem to add practical subjects, but they are still ""writing-based technical exams."" If practical tests of professional subjects can be added to the unified test, it will be possible to see the skills that students have cultivated in the past three years. For universities, students who have practical ability in this professional field can also be found, rather than just talking on paper.', 'Increase the professionalism, depth, and practicality of online teaching platform certificates, and promote themI know that these recommendations will never be seen by anyone, and it is impossible to really get a certain degree of attention. Although helpless in every possible way, I still want to offer my opinion. Increase the reliability of online universities. Background: At present, university studies in Taiwan seem to rely too much on learning in real life. For those who can’t do it (should not only have learning problems, more likely to be family background, or too smart, the school and peers can’t provide enough good and suitable education, etc.), in addition, in view of the fact that education below high school in Taiwan does not allow every student to grow appropriately and explore the best way to interact with the world. Therefore, the system of online learning is more needed so that everyone can choose the most suitable method. Make learning simpler, more choices and possibilities. Or maybe, people who are educated in such an environment can think more objectively about the syllabus of junior high schools. The current status of Air University: 1. The learning content is too narrow. Unable to learn professional knowledge. 2. Coupled with the current university master\'s transfer system, Kongda seems to lack recognition and cannot allow capable students to get the degrees they deserve. I believe that everyone is different. Some people think that they will be able to get along with others better after going to college, but let\'s discuss rationally. Is that a correct proposition? Is there any proof of that connection? Can it be more flexible, for example, you can transfer to Taiwan Tsinghua Jiaotong University in two years, as long as you have enough strength. People who can read and are willing to guard their wishes, I believe that if this society is full of opportunities and ""mistakes"" (maybe it\'s just choosing the wrong department, and the knowledge you learned from the mistakes you made before must be a kind of learning), can it make the society more prosperous and the atmosphere more flexible? I believe that many people must have imagined such a beautiful and ideal future. In the past, until now, many people regard studies as a battlefield, but I think that kind of thinking is inappropriate. Studies should not only be too negative competition, but should be more adaptable and self-centered. More diverse and more flexible. Vision and suggestions 1. Spiritual goal: increase learning opportunities, increase knowledge dissemination, so that everyone can receive higher education and receive knowledge. Let everyone have the opportunity to develop adaptively, still be full of hope for their own life, or enrich their own life and knowledge connotation. To increase the competitiveness of the country in a more friendly way. I believe that people who live happily will also be willing to treat others kindly and make this society more friendly and ideal. It also reduces the waste of money for useless courses in universities, the need to spend a lot of money on education, and the phenomenon that landlords are too easy to make money. It can be pushed slowly, and the rebound will not be so big. I really have to be honest, many courses in the university are too simple, and I am really embarrassed for four years. Make college credits like a package that can be split freely. (It is recommended not to break away from the major of the main axis, etc., under this principle). Implement the concept of ""credits"" more extensively. 2. How to practice: (1) Increase the depth, professionalism, and richness of the Air University courses, no longer only the liberal arts group. (2) Make the credits of air universities the same as those of universities, which means that students can transfer to another school, and can also provide entrance examination preparation, graduate school, master\'s degree, etc. (3) Fees and authentication methods: You can freely watch files and access knowledge content for free. If you need certificate credits, you need to take an exam and submit homework. If you need to get credits, you need to pay. Examination methods can be divided into unsecured online exams (you can refer to books), and some exams at designated places (some exams that need to be memorized, such as English). Depending on the situation, the details are subject to change. I believe that even if the credits are obtained in an improper way, there must be no benefit to the students (unless the credits are not verifiable, and they can still work well in the future). (4) Like the university system, there are things in the university, such as feedback from teachers on teaching, which can be used for reference to make the process of creation easier and less error-prone. (5) About outdoor activity courses, clubs, etc.: Outdoor activity courses can be combined with national sports centers in various places, or public and private institutions in various regions, or other colleges and universities (for example, Tainan Sicao can learn canoeing, a certain class at the University of Music), etc., combined with universities in various places. Make learning like a puzzle, and buy a package. time to be split. (6) Online interactive platform: Create a place where you can discuss homework and make friends with each other. Friendly learning, I think this can be slow or even unnecessary, because people will find their way elsewhere. Further study is required because the stakes are high. (There may be bad people occupying the discussion forum and the like)', 'University Tuition Free!! Implement fair value of technical expertise and academic knowledge!!Advocate tuition-free universities, but still need to pay miscellaneous fees, and the graduation rate will be reduced to below 70% within 5 years in stages. In today\'s society, a Taiwanese university degree is worthless. University education is a high-level education, but because Taiwan University is opened as a company, there are many places and the universities have no professional characteristics at all. It is tantamount to wasting parents’ money and the life time of the next generation in exchange for a “job ticket” that is not necessarily their own interest and major. 1. The practicality of university courses. One’s own talents are raised by themselves. Enterprises need talents. Enterprises are obliged to adopt and invest in the universities they like. It also enables students to be forward-looking and actively explore their own areas of strengths before university education, instead of only discovering that the department does not match their interests at the university stage, or that the department is not in the field that the students are good at, so that the talent time is wasted. 2. Improve learning ability. Graduation rate and course elimination rate are recommended to be adjusted in stages. No matter whether the grade reaches 60 points or not, only the students in the upper part of the grade will be allowed to pass according to the set elimination rate. Even if the grade reaches the passing score, the grades within the range of the elimination rate will be retaken. Unless the grades reach the high standard and the position can be exempted from retaking, otherwise retakes will be implemented to stimulate students’ learning ability, rather than make it normal to sleep in class. 3. The value of professional technology and academic knowledge is equal. Due to the graduation rate requirement, in a society with a declining birth rate, students will understand that in the case of insufficient self-viability, they should not waste time in receiving higher education. They should actively and quickly integrate into society to learn practical skills in the workplace. Having an economic foundation early not only increases the fertility rate, but also acquires more professional and technical learning contact time than others to accumulate seniority. 4. Improve the value of higher education In the case of reducing the graduation rate, it will further reduce the illusion of ""I have graduated from a university"" and the misunderstanding among peers such as ""he went to college, so I should go to it."" Students who are not clear about their own abilities also have the opportunity to choose higher education, compete fairly with other students, and will not give up the opportunity to receive higher education immediately after the completion of compulsory education due to the low graduation rate, and also achieve the ideal of talents receiving higher education at any time regardless of age.']"

After the current Mayor of Taichung, Lin Chia-lung, took office, he proposed that large electricity consumers need to install green energy power generation by 10% of their electricity consumption. Unexpectedly, there was much thunder and little rain. Large electricity consumers only need to provide a certificate, and there is not enough space to install it. This measure was completely ineffective. In order to avoid a one-time burden on the company and a reduction in profits, the target is set to increase year by year. For example, to reach 10% within five years, the increase can be increased by 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% in sequence. This will indirectly force the company to think about energy conservation and construction of green energy facilities, and increase the capital investment of related facilities. Sources of green energy 1. The company sets up green energy power generation itself (not yet sold to Taipower, the part for self-use) 2. Purchase with green energy certificate agency 3. Directly make up for the insufficient part with Taipower at the price of green energy (the total amount of green energy sold by Taipower must be less than the total amount purchased by Taipower, so as not to be questioned about Taipower’s long-standing problems. Green energy has no dedicated line and cannot distinguish green energy.) Assume that company A’s total electricity consumption is 100 million kilowatt-hours. After deducting the power generated by your own equipment, you can purchase it from the green energy certificate agency or other companies that have erected green energy facilities. The insufficient power will be calculated with the green electricity fee', 'Nuclear energy and green energy power generation electricity price classification systemNowadays, Taiwan’s power generation methods include nuclear energy, coal, gas, green energy, hydropower, wind power, etc. Power supply is in short supply every year, and due to the high awareness of environmental protection among too many people, it is impossible to achieve a relative balance between electricity consumption for people’s livelihood, industrial electricity consumption, and environmental protection. Therefore, it is recommended that the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs cooperate with Taipower to conduct a census of electric meter households. Environmentally conscious people use the electricity price of green energy, charge according to the selected method and population structure, and develop corresponding power. If the electricity is in short supply, they can conduct intermittent power outages for each household according to the power generation ratio, the selected power generation method, and the population structure.', 'Use oil money to raise green electricity, use oil money to save annuityIf you want to save the pension, no matter what the plan is, you must find a financial source that meets the following conditions: 1. It can be seen and touched; 2. The scale is large enough; 3. It can be adjusted. In my opinion, the only possible option left is ""gas money"". The tool to mobilize gas money is electric vehicles. As long as the electric vehicles use Taiwan\'s self-produced green electricity, the goal of retaining gas money has also been achieved simultaneously when the traffic demand is met. The total annual electricity consumption of all vehicles converted to electric vehicles in Taiwan is roughly equal to the total annual power generation of Taiwan\'s ""suitable"" installation of solar panels (with fluctuations of 20 billion kWh). That is to say, in theory, only relying on solar energy can completely retain gas money in Taiwan. If we make good use of the feature of ""off-peak charging"" of electric vehicles, and give priority to the ""instant use"" of solar power generation to meet the needs of air conditioning, these new power generation will greatly help reduce power consumption peaks and alleviate power shortages. That is to say, the core spirit of ""using oil money to raise green electricity"" lies in the ""transfer of cash flow"", and green electricity does not need to be directly charged into the battery. If you want to accelerate the promotion of electric vehicles, public support and voluntary cooperation are essential. The government should make good use of the key advantages of electric vehicles as a policy breakthrough: the mileage of electric vehicles consuming one kilowatt-hour of electricity is slightly equal to the mileage of one liter of gasoline consumed by traditional locomotives (up and down 35 kilometers). After the huge support and public opinion gradually gathers, we will take advantage of the momentum to promote four-wheel electric vehicles. I propose: the government buys batteries, and based on this, charges the knights with an amount ""equivalent to the price of oil"" when exchanging batteries, and then divides this amount into two parts, one part is used to buy green electricity at a high price, and the other part is linked to the price of natural gas and converted into a certain number of energy certificates. The conversion formula is as follows: 30 yuan (one liter of oil price) = 12 yuan (high price for energy creation) + 3 yuan (natural gas price) times 6 (energy certificates) The above energy certificates When the battery is exchanged, it is directly transferred to the knight account, which is easy to win the trust of the people. Linking natural gas prices is to pre-plan the electricity charges for converting coal-fired power generation to gas-fired power generation, and to avoid electricity price increases for ""anti-air pollution."" The government should legislate to require large electricity consumers to pay a certain percentage of electricity bills with energy certificates, thereby urging large electricity consumers to invest in green energy power generation and set up an exchange. Those who generate insufficient power must purchase energy certificates from electric motorcycle riders on the exchange. This plan imposes obligations on large electricity consumers, and the benefits go to riders who transfer to electric motorcycles. In the long run, Zaixu plans to replace natural gas with other types of self-produced new energy. Buying green electricity at a high price can be called ""creating energy at a high price"". The rapid growth of solar power generation is induced through the price mechanism, and the benefits of the high price go to millions of ""sun roofs"" without the risk of profiting from a specific financial group. The price of green electricity is initially set by the government, and when the conditions are ripe, the bidding is opened, and the free trading of green electricity is completed. The conversion formula of the above proposal is simple and clear. Through the repositioning of ""solar energy"" and ""electric vehicles"", innovative countermeasures are put forward in controversial hotspots such as electricity consumption, electricity price, air pollution, and carbon reduction. One day electric vehicles and new energy are fully promoted, and the ideal of ""saving pensions with fuel money"" can also be realized simultaneously, and it will happen naturally.']"

Talent is abused, resources are abused. We all know that Taiwan must change, but if only elected leaders and political officials are replaced, and the culture of the government\'s official business organization remains the same, it is really very difficult to bring about change! Therefore, we have a group of civil servants. After a period of discussion, we think that there are many problems, but if we can start with ""putting the right people in the right positions"" and ""giving room for those who are willing to do things"", various problems can be gradually dismantled. In the first step, we hope to establish a regular channel for grassroots civil servants to express their opinions: some policies lack practical considerations in the drafting stage, or when outdated laws and regulations make it difficult for grassroots civil servants to implement them, but there is no channel for feedback (the people still have the mailbox of the chief minister, but civil servants do not). Therefore, we suggest that a normal communication mechanism can be established. In the second step, in terms of talent selection methods, facing the characteristics of rapid changes in the international industry, the traditional written examination method is no longer in line with the needs of the times in some fields. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a more flexible talent appointment method; and conduct long-term training for potential civil servants. Through corporate cooperation and international exchanges, etc., cultivate civil servants with a ""cross-domain integration"" vision, ""problem-solving orientation"" and policy communication skills. However, when it comes to the need for more flexibility in the personnel appointment system, many netizens pointed out that everyone is worried that if a method other than the written test is used, it will lead to the situation of ""possibility of being shut down"". Therefore, we believe that putting an end to the ""personnel shutting down"" is a very important step. Only by returning talents to professional judgment can the government be more flexible in selecting talents. Therefore, we put forward three major demands, and hope everyone can support them: 1. The Executive Yuan should establish a channel for public servants to reflect their opinions and communicate with their superiors; 2. The government personnel department should introduce the concept of human resource management, so that it can be applied to talents and make them effective; (Detailed joint petitions are attached)', '1. According to the year-end performance appraisal of public servants, it should be handled in accordance with the Public Servant Performance Appraisal Act and its implementing rules, the Executive Yuan and its affiliated agencies’ daily appraisal points for public servants, etc. Among them, there is the parent law of the legal rank, that is, Article 5 of the Civil Servant Performance Appraisal Act. The year-end performance appraisal of public servants should be based on the usual appraisal. 2. However, in the Public Servant Performance Appraisal Law, there is no express restriction on the year-end performance appraisal of civil servants with an upper limit of 75%. The year-end performance evaluation of teachers and principals of public senior high schools and below is based on the regulations and orders such as public senior high school teachers\' performance evaluation methods and public senior high school principals\' performance evaluation methods. In the 1990s of the Republic of China, the Human Resources and Administration Department of the Executive Yuan only invited relevant executives to hold a meeting and discussed. The conclusion was: ""In principle, 50% of the number of people ranked first in the performance appraisal of each agency shall be limited, and the maximum shall not exceed 75%."" That is, the upper limit of the number of civil servants who are ranked first in the year-end performance appraisal is limited to 75% by order of authority, resulting in the restriction of the performance ratio of outstanding colleagues in the agency, and the year-end performance appraisal. The order violates Article 15 of the Constitution, which guarantees the basic rights of people\'s property rights. 3. To sum up, the smooth implementation of the policy of the Executive Yuan depends on the unremitting efforts of more than 90% of the civil servants in the administrative agency. However, in the evaluation of the year-end performance appraisal, the Ministry of Civil Service and the General Office of Personnel and Administration of the Executive Yuan only invited the relevant executives to hold a meeting to discuss the conclusions (refer to the Ministry of Civil Service\'s September 14, 1995 Bufa Erzi No. 0952700245) to issue power orders, infringing on the year-end efforts of most civil servants Publicly announce the results of the year-end performance appraisal, but fail to comply with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Central Regulations and Standards Act, and Article 7 and below of the Act on the Exercising of Powers of the Legislative Yuan. After the third reading of the Legislative Yuan, the public servants are not as good as public school teachers. The evil law of unilaterally restricting the proportion of the first-class performance appraisal of public servants to 75% by ex officio orders.小麗', 'Transforming Government: Building a Bottom-Up Force for Reform!Transforming Government: Building a Bottom-Up Force for Reform! Civil servants are probably one of the industries that are most likely to be discriminated against in this era. Civil servants are often scolded for being stupid, rice bugs, rigid, and inefficient. However, civil servants actually want to scold, why? We want to do things but it is so difficult to do? We want to be efficient but can\'t be effective? We often sigh, ""Some people criticize bad policies, but no one supports good policies."" We look forward to Taiwan moving forward. However, the president has changed, but the 300,000 civil service army has not changed. If the public service organization culture remains the same, there are still many areas that cannot be moved forward. Therefore, if we want to change, we must start with the change of official culture and system! We have a group of civil servants. After a period of discussion, we believe that if we can start with ""putting the right people in the right positions"" and ""giving civil servants who are willing to do things a space to play"", we can drive the next changes. First, we hope to establish a channel for civil servants to express their opinions on a regular basis. At present, apart from civil servants\' associations, there are almost no voice channels for civil servants, but can civil servants\' associations represent the opinions of reform? For a public servant with a heart, besides writing a letter directly to the media (like Yu Kai writing a letter directly to the Premier, after all, it is abnormal .. ), what else can he do? What\'s the point if opinions can\'t be conveyed? For example, some policies lack practical considerations in the drafting stage, or outdated laws and regulations make it difficult for grassroots civil servants to implement them, but there is no channel for feedback (the people still have the chief minister’s mailbox, but civil servants do not). Therefore, if a normal feedback mechanism can be established, the concept of rolling management can be implemented in policy implementation, and the real opinions fed back from grassroots executors will be of great help to policy makers. Second, we hope to create a more flexible talent appointment and holistic talent training system. Facing the characteristics of rapid changes in the international industry, the written examination method of the national examination does not meet the needs of the times in some fields (for example: Internet finance, smart cities, disaster prevention planning, climate change...), so it is necessary to introduce a more flexible talent appointment method; and conduct long-term training for potential civil servants. Through corporate cooperation and international exchanges, etc., cultivate civil servants with a ""cross-domain integration"" vision, ""problem-solving orientation"" and ""policy communication skills"". However, when it comes to making the selection/appointment system more flexible, many people are worried that once a method other than the written test is used, it will lead to a ""back door"" situation. Therefore, we have put forward three major appeals, and hope everyone can support them (see the attachment for detailed petitions): 1. The Executive Yuan should establish a channel for public servants to reflect their opinions and communicate with their superiors; 2. The government personnel department should introduce the concept of human resources management, so that talents can be used to their full potential; You can be very cold about politicians, and you can have no expectations for political parties, but the government is shared by everyone (everyone is a shareholder of the government!!), and you must try to make it better!']"

In addition to the loss of combat power, the players and coaches could not achieve the best adjustment, and even the most basic batting average could not be completed after spending 5 million on search. In 2013, the WBC also found that the Baseball Association was unable to arrange players' itineraries, insurance issues, and meal issues, and there was no way to check the prize money allocated for the final classic game. There is also no public account for all income from the top 12 games in Taiwan. The association has emphasized more times that players need to endure each other for the country, but it cannot improve the health guarantee of players. Legislators have also gradually examined the long-term injustice of the baseball association’s accounts. In the classic game, Taiwan was finally eliminated due to a losing streak. Facing the situation where the opponent cannot be accurately known, it is recommended to legislate or speed up the drafting of the National Sports Law, re-examine the procedures of various sports associations, adjust the registration procedures and powers and responsibilities of domestic and foreign competitions, force the associations that receive subsidies to disclose the details of budget usage, and propose to recover all illegal use of public funds, and then abolish the sports association."", 'The Baseball Association was reformed, and the Ministry of Sports was established by the state to directly govern the Baseball Association.

Since the organizational reform of the Executive Yuan, the Sports Committee has been downgraded to the Sports Department under the Ministry of Education. People can't help but feel that sports development has regressed, and the manpower and funds cannot reach the level of assistance to development. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has so many affairs that it is difficult to take into account the overall vision and detailed goals of sports development.

In the recent referendum case, there is a referendum tied to a general election. The following is a compromise solution and discussion after the referendum is passed in this case. Proposal: Currently, there is a requirement that five presentations or debates be held before the referendum polling date. Therefore, it is proposed to stipulate that the debates must be held 14 days before the referendum polling day (two weeks before the referendum). (Individual proposals are limited to 5 proposals, if the upper limit is exceeded) Currently, there are regulations that the competent authority shall announce the voting date, referendum case number, main text, statement of reasons, publication or debate period 90 days before the referendum day. Referendum Day is held every two years on the fourth Saturday in August. Therefore, for a referendum with more than 5 proposals and a follow-up pass threshold, as long as the leading proposers of more than 3 proposals are jointly signed 100 days before the general election, it can be held the day after the general election, and its presentation or debate can be handled together. And only a maximum of 5 cases can be held on the day after the general election (that is, a total of 10 cases must be confirmed 100 times before the general election, and more than 10 cases need to be postponed). Promised to exceed the upper limit of 10 cases, the next general election will be the main referendum day, but if the leader of the proposer who has accumulated more than 5 cases jointly proposes to deselect it from the general election, a referendum will be held on the fourth Saturday in August of the following year', 'Support for amending Section 23 of the Referendum Act to allow national referendums to be held separately from national elections, directly improving voting efficiency1. Why the proposal? On November 24, 2018, the 2018 ROC local public office elections and national referendums were held together. Cases 7 to 16 were held together. However, due to the large number of votes to be circled, the time required for each person to vote was greatly increased, resulting in long queues at polling stations on the day of voting, which greatly reduced the willingness of people who were in a hurry to vote. In addition, after the voting deadline at 4:00 p.m., some polling stations were still voting, and the votes were not completed until after 7:00 p.m., which caused chaos at some polling stations and some polling stations were still voting. 2. Suggested content: It is proposed to propose a draft amendment to Article 23 of the Referendum Law. Article 23 of the original Referendum Law states that “the competent authority shall hold a referendum within one month to six months after the establishment of the referendum. If there is a national election during this period, it shall be held on the same day as the election.” The part of “should be held on the same day as the election.” should be amended to “must be held on the same day as the election,” so that the national election is no longer mandatory to be held on the same day as the national referendum, so as to directly improve voting efficiency.', 'New SOP for the referendum tied to the general election: additional independent polling stations, and dual-track parallel adoption of I-VOTINGIn view of the nine-in-one election at the end of 2018 tied to a referendum, the poor design of the SOP caused many chaos, so a new SOP is proposed. 1. I-VOTING schedule: 60 days to 30 days before the election, for cases with successful joint signatures, natural person certificates will be opened for I-VOTING. 2. After the end of I-VOTING, the physical referendum will still be held. The Central Election Committee will make a list of citizens who have not yet voted. On the day of the election, only these people can receive the referendum ballot for the case, and others cannot. 3. Movement arrangement on the day of physical voting (1) Classroom: In the school or resident center of each polling station, an additional room or classroom is dedicated to the polling station, and the resident citizens in the neighborhood where elections are not held all vote in the same classroom. (2) Circle polls: each public polling station has at least 6. (3) Cartons: according to the number of cases, make as many as there are cases, do not put the same one for every 3 cases. 4. Amending the law to allow referendum publicity: In order to increase the turnout rate of the referendum, various proposal groups are allowed to enter the school to promote on the same day, but if the proposer is also a candidate or a political party, this person is not allowed to enter the publicity; 5. Voting: At the end of 4:00 p.m., referendums and elections, whoever has digested the crowd, will vote first, regardless of the other party. At this time, the Election Committee will also officially announce the number of I-VOTING, and finally add the number of ballots for the referendum to be the final result.']"

For the perpetrator, sexual assault is just a pleasure, but for the victim, it often brings a lifetime of psychological pain and scars. The current sentence is three to ten years, which is far less than the harm the perpetrator brought to the victim. If the perpetrator behaves well in prison, the sentence can be greatly reduced. In society, victims of sexual assault often suffer secondary harm, and the reporting rate of sexual assault is low. If the sentence is too light, the victim will have no justice, and feel that it is ""not worth it"" to endure the accusations that will be received after reporting the crime. It is recommended to increase the penalty for sexual assault, with a minimum of five years and a maximum of at least 20 years, or even 30 years or life imprisonment is better. Give judges more leeway in sentencing. Powerful sexual assault brings the same harm to victims as ordinary sexual assault, but they will be accused more.

The so-called temptation, of course, refers to money, material, or verbal provocations, which lead these people to have relationships with adults before their sexual autonomy or sexual characteristics are fully mature; however, before the age of 16, it is up to the parents to represent the child to decide whether to reconcile. What is the problem? Can the defendant be brought to justice only if the child is forced to have sexual intercourse. If it is a child who is not forced, deceived, or lured, we cannot deal with it according to forced sexual intercourse, but must give these adults a verdict of not guilty? It is difficult to prove whether minors have sex out of consent, which is the origin of Article 227 of the Criminal Law. However, recently there have been many cases of adults having sex with minors but being sentenced lightly by judges. Because it is impossible to determine whether minors are voluntary, because they are determined to have a relationship between men and women based on the information on the line, regardless of the fact that the defendant has self-harmed. Article 221 of the Criminal Law clearly violates the original intent of the legislation. Frankly speaking, adult men and women have a certain emotional basis. If they do not want to have sex, they can still sue the other party for hindering their sexual autonomy. The judge will still consider whether it is a false accusation. Difficulty in proving that the original purpose was to protect the underage victim, but now it has become a reason for the perpetrator to receive a lighter sentence; the other is a case where an adult had sex with a minor and was sentenced to a lighter sentence by the judge because the victim’s mother pleaded for mercy on her behalf. The Criminal Law already has article 227-1 on commutation, but the judge still commuted the defendant’s sentence in accordance with other laws. It must be sentenced, which undoubtedly hurts the juvenile victim again. Therefore, I imitate the international minimum legal sexual intercourse age (internationally, most of them are about 13 to 16 years old), and having sex with a person below this age is directly regarded as the crime of impeding sexual autonomy and is no longer the quasi-rape crime (France has recently considered amending the law in this direction), and increases its punishment and sets the minimum basic sentence. Article 227 of the Criminal Law can be amended, and its basic criminal responsibility cannot be reduced by other laws except for the circumstances set by Article 227-1 of the Criminal Law. There are heard of sexual assault cases at home and abroad, and the cases of female sexual assault are much higher than that of men. They are subdivided into male adults sexually assaulting female adults, male adults, female minors and male minors; female adults sexually assaulting male adults, male minors, female female adults and female minors; Therefore, I do not agree with the provision of childhood sweethearts for minors. The first sexual act of an underage woman in an incomplete state of mind and body is the first time she is coaxed or abducted. Regardless of whether her object is an adult or a minor, the public should not be ignorant of the facts. It is believed that underage men will not deceive underage women. I believe that in Article 227-1 of the Criminal Law, underage women must be exempted from punishment. Based on the protection of children’s rights, I claim that only commutation clauses can be applied to underage men, so as to curb more and more underage sexual assault cases committed by themselves. They should not be exempted from punishment and decriminalized. This does not discriminate against underage men, but faces the existence of facts.

However, the use of guns by the police is often subject to many regulations. After shooting the criminals, they are prosecuted for professional negligence. For various reasons, the police do not dare to use guns, and some criminal suspects act irrationally against the police because the police do not dare to use guns. In order to prevent similar situations from happening, can the police be uniformly equipped with non-lethal weapons such as stun guns to maintain society? Law and order has an intimidating effect.', 'Amendments to increase police powers to shootThe police are the nannies of the people, and they are also the last line of defense against the underworld to maintain social order. In recent years, the police have been punished by judges for heavy compensation for shooting in order to enforce the law. The income of the police cannot afford it, and it even causes the police to be mentally stressed and afraid to shoot. How can the police lose their weapons to maintain law and order and protect the good people? Please legislators can amend the law to increase the power of the police to shoot in law enforcement. When the police are in danger or based on the right to protect the lives of others, they can shoot and enforce the law without legal punishment. The previous medical amendments protect the right of medical staff to avoid threats, and the police who work and rest abnormally and tiredly should also be protected. Without police law enforcement, how can there be a safe society? I implore the Executive Yuan to propose a law to protect the police so that the power of police guns can be improved, so that they will not worry about being severely punished afterwards', 'Adjusted police gun use timing and restrictionsProposal content: Due to the imperfect timing of the use of police weapons in the current law, and the increasing number of police firearm disputes in recent years, the police are afraid to shoot when performing their duties, which often puts many police officers in unnecessary danger during the law enforcement process. In addition, if the suspect flees from the pursuit, it may cause social security concerns. It is hoped that the use of regulations can be adjusted to ensure the safety of police law enforcement, so that the police can greatly reduce the death rate when they are on duty or chasing suspects, and can actually complete the arrest. Suggestions: 1. Amend the bill to relax the restrictions on the use of guns by the police, for example: Article 6 of the Police Arms Use Regulations ""Do not use firearms beyond the necessary level"" 2. Strengthen the police\'s situational training to make a more appropriate response at the moment 3. After deterring or warning, the suspect still picks up the firearms controlled by the Firearms, Ammunition and Ammunition Control Act, brandishes or shoots, and the police can directly shoot the suspect. Use this to calculate in detail the proportion of responsibility for shooting that caused casualties, and give it to the court as a basis for trial. 5.

Tobacco products are the number one killer of health hazards: (1) There are more than 7,000 chemical substances in cigarettes, 93 of which are carcinogenic and harmful substances, and 15 of them are listed as ""Class I carcinogens"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Among the top 10 causes of death in my country, 6 (malignant tumors, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory disease) are directly related to smoking, and 4 (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephropathy, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, accident injury, suicide) are indirectly related to smoking. About 27,000 people die from smoking in my country every year, with an average of 1 person dying from smoking every 20 minutes. Among them, cancer ranks first and accounts for 50% (57% of lung cancer, 22% of oral and pharyngeal cancer), followed by cardiovascular diseases at 28%, and respiratory diseases at 22%. (2) Another study confirmed that exposure to second-hand smoke can also increase the risk of dying from lung cancer. Living with smokers, the chance of getting lung cancer is 20%-30% higher than that of the general public. Long-term exposure to second-hand smoke can cause or aggravate respiratory diseases in children, and is related to childhood leukemia, lymphoma, brain and central nervous system lesions, hepatoblastoma and other cancers. The World Health Organization reported in March 2017 that the number one cause of death among children under the age of 5 is respiratory infection caused by air pollution and ""second-hand smoke"", which kills 570,000 children around the world every year. Another recent study found that third-hand smoke can cause respiratory problems in infants, increase the chances of infants with asthma, cause them to lose weight, and increase the risk of otitis media. 2. Public Health England (PHE) reports that the health risk of e-cigarettes is at least 95% lower than that of traditional cigarettes: (1) Professor John Newton, director of the PHE Health Care Division, pointed out that the health risks of e-cigarettes are at least 95% lower than that of traditional cigarettes, which is only 1/20 of traditional cigarettes, but more than half of addicts do not know this. Newton believes that it is ""very regrettable"" if addicts do not use e-cigarettes to quit smoking because of misconceptions. The report shows that the number of people using e-cigarettes in the UK is close to 3 million, and there has been little change in the past few years; e-cigarettes can help at least 20,000 people in the UK to quit smoking every year, but about 40% of addicts in the UK have not tried e-cigarettes. (2) The report also stated that the existing evidence does not support the view that e-cigarettes make it easy for young people to start smoking traditional cigarettes. The smoking rate among young people in the UK is continuing to decline, and there are fewer and fewer young people who smoke regularly. In addition, the smoke from e-cigarettes is not harmful to those near the smoker. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) also believes that the health hazards of e-cigarettes are far less than that of traditional cigarettes. (3) Lance Norman, CEO of Hapai Te Hauora in New Zealand, said: If you want to achieve the 2025 smoke-free goal, you need to ban the sale of cigarettes, so that 5,000 people in New Zealand will not die of smoking-related diseases every year. ""So our view is that we should have an aggressive strategy to get people off cigarettes. This would require passing legislation to ban the sale of cigarettes by 2025. This ban could be phased in, first removing cigarette products from convenience stores and liquor stores, and then from other sources."" Some steps are already being taken as a way to reduce the harm of smoking, for example through the use of e-cigarettes, but Norman said it needs to be accelerated. Some e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and Norman believes governments should promote these products through public campaigns funded by tobacco taxes to help people quit smoking. 3. Nicotine is not the main cause of health hazards of smoking: PHE reports that many people have misunderstandings about nicotine. In fact, most of the health hazards of smoking are not caused by nicotine, but less than 1/10 adults understand this. Lead author Ann McNeill, a professor at King\'s College London, said that when people smoke traditional cigarettes, the smoke they inhale contains 7,000 harmful substances, 70 of which are known carcinogens. ""Contrary to what most people think, nicotine is less harmful."" However, the opinions of academics and health agencies in various countries on e-cigarettes have always been controversial. A 2016 U.S. government report concluded that youth use of e-cigarettes has become a ""public health threat"" in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued a report stating that there is no sufficient evidence that e-cigarettes can help quit smoking, and smokers can only protect their health to the greatest extent by completely quitting nicotine. In order to prevent young people from being poisoned, both the United Kingdom and the United States currently legislate to prohibit the sale of electronic cigarettes and related products to young people under the age of 18. Taiwan\'s Executive Yuan will pass the draft amendment to the ""Tobacco Hazard Prevention Law"" on December 21, 2017, which will prohibit the manufacture, import and sale of electronic cigarettes. Based on the position of safeguarding the health of the people and the revision of the law should be consistent, please ask the government to revise the law: completely prohibit the manufacture, import, and sale of traditional cigarettes (cigarettes), electronic cigarettes, and heated cigarettes.', 'Held a public hearing on the revision of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes (smoke-free substitutes)The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that one billion people will die from cigarettes in this century. Cigarettes kill more than 7 million people every year, of which more than 6 million people are due to direct use of cigarettes, and about 890,000 people are non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Overall, one person dies from smoking in less than 5 seconds. According to statistics from the National Health Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, about 27,000 people die from smoking in Taiwan every year, and one person dies from smoking every 20 minutes. Concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction and Prevention Proper taxation and regulation can help reduce health harm There are more than 7,000 chemical substances in cigarette smoke, of which 93 are carcinogenic and harmful substances, and 15 of them are listed as ""Class I carcinogens"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Experts from the Taiwan Tobacco Harm Reduction Initiative, the only one in the world that has obtained the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) smokeless tobacco certificate, said that smoking is harmful to health. If you can stop smoking, you should stop smoking. If you are smoking, the best way for your health is to quit smoking. However, for the large number of smokers who are unable to quit smoking or do not want to quit smoking, if the government can properly tax and regulate smoke-free substitutes, it will undoubtedly reduce the health damage caused by cigarettes to smokers, and at the same time greatly reduce the negative impact of second-hand smoke and cigarette butts on non-smokers and the environment. E-cigarettes, heating tobacco iQOS Reasonable regulation is the key. The 2020 World Health Organization European Branch e-cigarette report clearly pointed out that the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Engineering and the School of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control have all recognized the potential of e-cigarettes to improve public health. The WHO also emphasized that the government\'s reasonable regulation of e-cigarettes is the key. The goal is to minimize the consequences of the tobacco epidemic and continue to bring positive effects to public health. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent non-smokers, especially young people, from being exposed to nicotine, and fully consider the interests of smokers to find a balance in regulation. The US FDA allows the sale of heated cigarettes. Data show that it can reduce the risk of exposure to harmful substances. The US FDA approved the application for the sale of heated tobacco iQOS in the US in 2019. The US FDA stated that the data submitted by the industry shows that the use of licensed information to sell these specific products will help addicted adult smokers get rid of traditional combustion cigarettes and reduce smokers’ exposure to harmful chemicals on the premise that smokers completely switch to use. In addition, the U.S. FDA also agrees that the heated tobacco iQOS can be sold in the local market as a ""risk-modified tobacco product"" and can be labeled with promotional slogans such as ""reduce consumers\' exposure to harmful chemicals in cigarettes"".', '1. Prohibit the manufacture, import and sale of cigarettes in Taiwan. 2. Promote the legalization of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes.Proposals: 1. Prohibit the manufacture, import and sale of cigarettes in Taiwan. 2. Promote the legalization of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s response to Wang Yuyang’s proposal of “holding a public hearing on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco (smoke-free substitutes) amendments” on November 11, 2020: 1. According to the results of the survey on youth smoking behavior by the National Health Service in 2018, the use rate of e-cigarettes among national and high school students increased by 2.5% and 5.6% respectively. The harm is serious, the empirical data is clear, and the protection of the health of minors is the foundation of national competitiveness and sustainable development. The Ministry of Health and Welfare opposes the manufacture, import and sale of electronic cigarettes. So my first proposal: Prohibit the manufacture, import and sale of cigarettes in Taiwan. In response to the first point above, which one is more important, the health of teenagers or the health of adults? I think life is just as important. Since the hazards of electronic cigarettes are serious, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare opposes their manufacture, import and sale, general cigarettes should be treated similarly, and their manufacture, import and sale should be prohibited. 2. The draft amendment to the Tobacco Hazard Control Law was sent to the Executive Yuan for review on October 20, 2019, and is scheduled to be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review during this session. The key points of the revision include strict control of e-cigarettes and other new products that meet the definition of smoking products, raising the age of smoking products to 20 years old, expanding the ban on smoking in indoor public places, increasing the area of \u200b\u200bwarning graphics, and strictly prohibiting the sponsorship of smoking products. To strengthen the source of emerging tobacco control laws and jointly protect the health of the next generation. In response to the second point above, although the Tobacco Hazard Prevention Law has been amended and there are more areas where smoking is strictly prohibited, it is difficult to enforce the ban. For example, smoking in a no-smoking area, if the police did not ban it as an active crime, the public would have no evidence to report it. Although littering cigarette butts can be fined, but the smoke damage has already been caused, and the punishment after the fact will not help the prevention and control of smoke damage at all. Although there are more and more no-smoking areas, people can always find a place to smoke, and second-hand smoke is far and wide, and anyone can smell it. Now smoking is not allowed indoors, so people smoke in arcades and sidewalks. People walking on sidewalks and arcades cannot escape the harm of second-hand smoke. However, cigarettes are harmful to the health of the people, and there must be reasons why the first proposal has not been implemented for decades. Therefore, the second proposal is proposed: to promote the legalization of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes. First of all, I want to state my position. I don’t smoke and I hate second-hand smoke very much. I suffer from second-hand smoke in my life. The reason why I hope e-cigarettes and heated cigarettes are legalized has nothing to do with the health of smokers. Smokers are responsible for their own health. My original intention is to protect the health of non-smokers. It is not illegal for a person to commit suicide with a knife, but it is illegal to kill someone with a knife. If you want to smoke, you can do whatever you want without affecting others. But what smokers can affect others is second-hand smoke. About cigarette smoke There are two types of cigarette smoke, mainstream smoke and sidestream smoke. The so-called ""mainstream smoke"" is the smoke inhaled into the lungs of the smoker, while ""sidestream smoke"" is the smoke from the lit cigarette. According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health: The tar in sidestream smoke is three to four times that of mainstream smoke, nicotine is two to eight times, benzoin pyrene (the carcinogen Benzpyren) is three to seven times, carbon monoxide is four to seven times, and ammonia, which can irritate the eyes and nose, is as high as fifty times. Non-smokers are often forced to inhale ""sidestream smoke"". The harm caused by ""sidestream smoke"" to non-smokers cannot be ignored. Let me emphasize again that the health of the smoker is his own responsibility, so ""mainstream smoke"" will not be discussed here. What causes harm to non-smokers is ""sidestream smoke"". Although smokers do not want to create ""sidestream smoke"" to affect others, there is nothing they can do about smoking. The second point of my proposal is to promote the legalization of e-cigarettes and heated cigarettes, which can completely stop the generation of ""sidestream smoke"" and protect the rights and interests of non-smokers. Without ""sidestream smoke"", Taiwan\'s gutter covers will not become ashtrays. Without ""sidestream smoke"", the smoker can enjoy his nicotine at home without having to go to the toilet to smoke and affect the entire pipe room. Without ""sidestream smoke"", there will be no public safety fire incidents caused by cigarette butts. Without ""sidestream smoke"", arcade sidewalks will not be reduced to smoking areas. Without ""sidestream smoke"", you can smoke openly without affecting the health of others, and you don\'t need to deceive your wife to smoke secretly, reducing the deception between husband and wife. Without ""sidestream smoke"", the health of non-smokers can be truly guaranteed, and smokers can\'t save him no matter whether ordinary cigarettes or electronic cigarettes. E-cigarettes, e-cigarettes for heated cigarettes, and nicotine liquids can also be taxed and regulated. Now the tobacco manufacturers of general cigarettes are also starting to produce electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes. Cigarettes that generally produce ""side-stream smoke"" will be taxed more heavily, and smokers will be fined heavily if ""side-stream smoke"" is found in no-smoking areas. If the government vigorously promotes electric vehicles for the sake of environmental protection and air quality, then promoting the legalization of e-cigarettes and heated cigarettes without ""sidestream smoke"" can have more direct and effective health benefits for the Chinese people. I don\'t smoke, and I support the legalization of e-cigarettes.']"

However, small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed on the road section if there is no traffic jam."" The function of the expressway and expressway itself is to provide passers-by with a fast and safe way to reach the destination. However, although this regulation has defined the inner lane as the overtaking lane, there is a proviso that small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed on the road section if there is no traffic jam. In the description of this regulation, the traffic conditions without congestion and the maximum speed limit are very vague definitions. What is a blockage? two cars? Three cars or four cars? How much lower is the speed? Vehicle density within one kilometer of a single lane (inner, middle, outer)? Top speed limit? The speed limit on the car\'s dashboard? GPS speed limit? 110 km/h? Or add 119 km/h within the allowable range? The above two nouns are very vague terms, and there is no clear definition of how to distinguish them. As a result, people\'s interpretation of the regulations is distorted, thinking that keeping a speed of 100 km/h or more is the highest speed limit, and they can drive in the inner lane for a long time and for a long distance. But the speedometer of each car is different. Maybe you have reached 100 km/h or more, but my car has not, so what should I do? In this way, everyone\'s perception of the regulations is absolutely strange. You can imagine the weird scene of overtaking lanes formed on the outer lines of the expressway. This provision shall take the initial purpose of the highway as the starting point, and the principle of priority to reach the destination priority safely and quickly should define this provision as ""the inner lane is overtaking. In addition to overtaking, it shall not stay in the inner lane. Of course, the national road police should also increase the frequency of law enforcement and avoid over -speed ban to avoid unscrupulous parts through the inside. The side lanes drive at a speed at a high speed to endanger the safety of others. Finally, the inner side should be a simple overtaking lane. Even if you drive no matter how much you use, you cannot take up for a long time. Giving way to the overtaking lane and whether the vehicle behind is speeding are two different things and should not be confused. After overtaking, you should immediately give way to the overtaking lane. If the vehicle behind is speeding, it can be reported to the National Highway Police to ban it. If you have a qualified reporting device, you can also use the method of reporting for the police to ban. Only in this way can we re-establish the use order of the lanes on the expressway, increase the speed of the expressway, and establish a friendly driving environment! Foreign countries already have a very mature concept of driving. We should learn from them. After the overall quality of the people in our country is improved, it may not be a dream to have unlimited speed highways one day. I hope that the Ministry of Communications and the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior will pay attention to this issue. I don’t think political officials want to be scolded for traffic jams every time they have consecutive holidays! To encourage each other', 'Solve the problem of overtaking lanes occupied by national highways, and separate the ""right to use"" and ""speed limits"" of overtaking lanesCurrent Situation and Problems (A) Article 8, Paragraph 3 of the Traffic Control Regulations for Expressways and Expressways: Small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed on the road section if there is no traffic jam. (B) Item 2 of Article 33 of the Road Traffic Penalty Regulations stipulates that the inner lane of the expressway should be an overtaking lane. After overtaking, if there is a safe distance and the driver fails to return to the original lane, causing traffic congestion in the overtaking lane, the driver will be fined NT$6,000 to NT$12,000. (C) The National Highway Police explained: ""The inner lane is an overtaking lane, \'not a speeding lane\'. Small cars driving in the inner lane at the highest speed limit are in compliance with the regulations"" (National Highway Police Bureau fan page po article https://goo.gl/SafM5q) (D) National Highway Police responded to the driving records and reported the use of overtaking lanes: ""In order to ban violations of slow-speed vehicles that do not follow the prescribed lanes, it is necessary to use a speed measuring instrument certified by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to measure the speed data to determine whether it is sufficient It is determined that there is such a violation.” Since it is not difficult for vehicles to exceed the speed limit nowadays, many drivers do not have the correct concept of using the overtaking lane. The problem is not that increasing the speed limit of the overtaking lane can improve it, but that the current regulations combine the ""right to use"" and ""speed limit"" of the overtaking lane in the same article, and there is no mandatory provision for overtaking lanes to give way. In addition, general drivers do not have qualified speed measuring instruments, that is, speed measuring guns and fixed speed measuring rods, so it is completely impossible to prove that the lane is occupied. Car speedometers, driving readings, and the actual size of tires from various manufacturers all cause errors. If the car behind (gauge speed 115 km/h, real speed 110 km/h) wants to overtake the car in front (gauge speed 110 km/h, real speed 100 km/h), the driver of the front car can claim to be driving at the highest speed and has the right not to give way. From the perspective of law enforcement, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of vehicles flow on the national highway every day. Even if the national highway police are determined to enforce the law, it is impossible to effectively stop the occupation of the inner lane by manpower. In view of the above, it is necessary to change the law and let the community forces work together to report the driving record video to solve the problem. The PO article on the fan page of the National Highway Police Bureau on February 7, 2017, describing the video of the National Highway Police stopping the turtle car and billing it, received more than 26,000 likes and 22,000 shares, which is 100 times higher than other PO articles, showing how much the public hates the turtle car inside.

Ability to use passing lanes should be independent of speed. In the case of light traffic, as long as there is no overtaking behavior, you should not drive into the overtaking lane. Just like no matter the speed per hour, cars should not drive on arcades, sidewalks or opposite lanes, because there is no ""right to use"" to drive there. [Give way] As above, if the speed of the vehicle behind is faster than that of the vehicle in front in the overtaking lane, the vehicle in front must return to the center line to give way after the vehicle behind uses its horn and flashing lights to indicate overtaking. [Keep up with the traffic flow] Drive in separate lanes according to the speed of the vehicle. You must keep up with the speed of the traffic flow in the lane. The outer side is slower, and the inner side is faster. If you drive in the middle and inner lanes and cannot keep up with the speed of the traffic flow, and do not lean towards the outermost lane, you will be fined according to the standard for slow vehicles. [Occupancy and blocked lane reporting] If the vehicle in front refuses to yield, the vehicle behind proposes a driving record video of ""the vehicle behind in the inner lane returns to the center line and overtakes the vehicle in front on the inside"" (proves that the vehicle in front has enough space to back off), or ""there is another vehicle on the center line entering the overtaking lane in front of the vehicle in front"" (proves that the vehicle in front did not speed up to keep up with the traffic flow, and the center line has enough space to back off), or ""there are n consecutive cars in the outer lane that are faster than a car on the inner side"" (proves that the vehicle in front cannot keep up with the traffic flow and does not move to the outside), namely If it proves that the vehicle in front occupies the lane and causes blockage, it shall be fined according to relevant regulations. This method of reporting occupied lanes does not require a speed certificate from a qualified instrument, which can be distinguished with the naked eye. [Exceptional situation] In the case of heavy overall traffic flow, the following car will not be able to present the above video. In order to effectively use the road and ease the traffic flow, the above-mentioned regulations may not be restricted. [Overtaking speed limit] When there is ""overtaking behavior"" in the ""overtaking lane"", you can temporarily drive at a speed within ""speed limit + N"". After overtaking, you must drop back to within the speed limit and back to the center lane. If there is no overtaking behavior, the speed limit of the road section should still be obeyed. [Overtaking on the left] In order to reduce the visual blind spot and facilitate the detection of the vehicle in front, overtaking is only allowed from the left side of the vehicle in front, which conforms to the above-mentioned rule that the outer side is slower and the inner side is faster.', ""Domestic expressways and expressways should legislate to increase the speed limit of the inner lane, and effectively implement the concept of using the inner overtaking lane.Preface Based on more than 15 years of driving experience and observations on national highways and expressways at home and abroad, the author understands that Chinese people still have insufficient knowledge of highway driving and driving, which leads to frequent accidents on domestic highways and extremely serious congestion. Argument According to the advanced road design and use cognition at home and abroad, the inner (most left) lane of the expressway is designed to be the best use efficiency. It should be an overtaking lane and should be kept clear and high-speed at all times to ensure that vehicles in this lane can effectively overtake vehicles in the middle and outer lanes. And let other vehicles brake frequently to slow down the average speed of the overall expressway; According to the theory of traffic science, the expressway is a miniature version of the butterfly effect. When a few vehicles brake improperly or frequently, it will easily lead to traffic jams in the rear section. Taiwan's expressways are inefficient and extremely prone to traffic jams. This problem should be solved. Proposal Based on the above reasons, the author proposes to adopt the simplest law improvement method, which is to increase the legal speed limit of the inner lane, so as to encourage the pedestrians to increase the speed of the inner lane, and to force the occupants to leave the lane at high speed and give way. The increased speed limit should be at least 10-20km/h higher than the maximum speed limit of the road section. For example, the inner lane of a section with a speed of 100 kilometers per hour should be 110-120 kilometers per hour. In addition to increasing the speed limit of the inner lane, regulations should also be added to require that when a vehicle in the middle and outer lane intends to overtake a vehicle approaching on the left, it should allow the vehicle on the left to enter the lane for overtaking. Strengthen the norms of overtaking behavior to avoid danger and slow down of vehicles on national roads caused by frequent braking due to improper behavior of other vehicles. Amendments to Regulations The following provisions should be amended as proposed above to increase the permissible speed limit for small cars on the inner lane. According to Article 8, Example 3 of Expressway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulations, the inside lane is the overtaking lane. However, small cars can drive in the inner lane at the maximum speed limit allowed by the road section under the condition of not blocking the traffic. In addition, the behavior regulations of overtaking vehicles and vehicles being overtaken should be strengthened. If the vehicle intends to overtake another vehicle, it must flash the direction lights and speed up to overtake; while in the middle and outer lanes, if the vehicle on the left wants to turn into the bicycle lane, it should give way without speeding up.""]"

If this second proposal is passed, students will be able to make good use of the extended rest time brought by early school dismissal, so as to alleviate the situation of always busy wandering between school and cram school, and returning home until it is dark to start reading and writing homework. It can even reduce the health burden caused by students going to bed late, having dark circles, lack of energy the next day, and hindering development. The previous (Section 8) can be adjusted earlier or canceled, and it can also be stipulated that the system will be implemented one week before the section test (Section 7). Achieve the benefits of 1 shortening the class time and 2 lengthening the rest time after school."", 'It is proposed to adjust the start and end time of junior high school (8:00～16:00)According to the recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, adolescents need 8-10 hours of sleep per day, but according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 60% of middle school students and 70% of high school students cannot sleep for a full 8 hours. Baston, a professor of biobehavioral health at the University of Pennsylvania, published a paper ""Sleep Health"" in the journal of the National Sleep Foundation in 2017, pointing out that class time is one of the main factors affecting the sleep of middle school students. He found that middle school students whose class time is between 7:00 and 7:20, compared with their peers who go to school after 8:30, have an average of 46 minutes less sleep time per day, and emotional disorders, obesity, health and other problems caused by lack of sleep are more likely to appear in adolescents, and are accompanied by poor academic performance..., time constraints It makes students feel rushed and busy physically and mentally. The above description is the problem pointed out in the research report. I hope to adjust the time to go to school or the time to leave school to shorten the time that students spend in school a day, so that going to school is no longer just a part of the busy life of the day, but a place for students to learn knowledge. Therefore, adjusting the time in a timely manner will greatly increase the learning points, and will no longer make students feel very tired and troubled because of the time problem.', ""At present, middle school students in Taiwan generally lack sleep, and middle school students should delay their school timeAt present, middle school students in Taiwan generally lack sleep, and the school time for middle school students should be delayed. Nowadays, students often have to study until very late due to academic pressure, which is the same as an adult's work + overtime time. However, lack of sleep, learning absorption and endurance can not improve performance and hinder development. Benefits and influences As people get older, the influence will become more pronounced when they reach the post-adolescent stage of high school. Students at this age are equally delayed going to bed and waking up. Asking them to wake up at 7 am is like asking a 50-year-old teacher to wake up at 4:30 am. Under the current education system, the school time is not adjusted according to the biological clock of young people, and the accumulated lack of sleep for a long time will significantly harm the health of students. And delaying the class time is beneficial to both students and teachers. Only when you get enough sleep will your grades be good? 90% agree to delay class for one hour and sleep well. Students have better grades in class after 10 o'clock. 1/4 teenagers have suffered from insomnia. Poor sleep affects their studies. British and American research----teenagers go to school at 10 o'clock, which can help improve their grades! ------Also talk about the influence of sleep phase shift on middle school students' learning efficiency and emotional disorders""]"

The current regulations of the Republic of China that distinguish people from the Taiwan region, the mainland region, and the Hong Kong and Macau regions are the Constitution of the Republic of China, the amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of China, the Nationality Law, the Regulations on the Relations between People of the Taiwan Region and the Mainland Region, and the Regulations on the Relations between Hong Kong and Macao. The most ambiguous question is whether the people of the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau are nationals of the Republic of China. If it is according to the Constitution of the Republic of China, because the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau are the legal territories of the Republic of China, the people are of course citizens of the Republic of China. But according to the law, it is not at all. First, they do not have ROC national identity cards, ROC passports or nationality documents issued by the ROC. Second, they have not fulfilled the obligations of ROC nationals. Third, they do not enjoy the rights of ROC nationals. According to the laws of the Republic of China, the People\'s Republic of China is not recognized, so the nationality of the People\'s Republic of China will not be recognized, so the distinction between people in Taiwan, the mainland, and Hong Kong and Macau is based on household registration, not nationality. Now that the substantive jurisdiction over the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau has been lost, it is suggested that the people of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau should be designated as ""stateless persons"".

However, some driving reforms often ignore other passers-by and residents adjacent to the main road, and prohibiting the modification of automobiles and motorcycles to issue fines cannot effectively prevent this situation. Appropriate management can effectively control and significantly reduce road noise pollution than blindly prohibiting it. Therefore, it is recommended to levy automobile and motorcycle noise taxes. As mentioned above, it is understood that some users who modified their exhaust pipes to cause high-decibel noise will replace the original exhaust pipes with the car body after being reported and fined, and then go to the car for inspection. Citizens report or the police use public power to stop and check. Once the test is higher than a certain standard, the noise tax of automobiles and motorcycles will be levied. The level of the series will be used as the fine standard. And in order to avoid the situation where the tube is changed to cope with the inspection, if it is determined to exceed the standard after inspection, but it has been registered and canceled, it should be regarded as a repeat offender, and the tax rate is doubled to avoid fluke.', 'The noise problem of the ""exhaust pipe"" of the locomotive is included in the mandatory inspection. And whether it is ""illegal"" to issue penalties without detection in the form of ""announcement""Reason for suggestion: I am a resident of New Taipei City. When I was passing through Sanchong this year, I was stopped by the police. The policeman asked me about my exhaust pipe. The policeman said that he could only take pictures of the exhaust pipe of the auxiliary factory. The supervisory unit will determine whether there is a violation. The policeman does not have any equipment to detect the noise, so I asked if I will receive a ""ticket"" or ""vehicle inspection form"". The policeman only said that he was only responsible for taking pictures. Suggestions for this case: 1. There was no noise inspection on the spot, and only the police took pictures. Can the supervisory unit determine violations based on the photos? Currently, the penalty is based on the use of unapproved exhaust pipes during the prohibited period (22:00-6:00) in the ""New Taipei City Announcement"", and the bill can be issued without inspection. -> Adopt the ""behavior law"" interpretation, that is, the violation can be presumed and punished without ""proving evidence"". The question is, how do you know whether it is qualified or not? At present, the annual mandatory inspection of locomotives is only ""exhaust"". If you want to fine ""noise"", whether to include ""noise"" in the mandatory inspection items. ” or “qualified exhaust pipe”, can fines be issued based on suspicion but without “proof”? Then the police only need to say that it is the responsibility of other “organizations” and they can perfectly shirk their responsibility. In the case of incomplete regulations, the government allows private sales of modified parts, and the authority and responsibility for the modification is the supervision station, and the noise management unit is indeed the Environmental Protection Bureau. Take exhaust pipes in (New Taipei City) as an example: the Economic and Trade Bureau allows the sale of auxiliary factory exhaust pipes (the public can also legally obtain them), and the supervision station announced that they can install exhaust pipes without reporting. There is an option for exhaust pipes! This is a big problem. 1. At present, ""noise"" is not included as a mandatory inspection item. 2. The Environmental Protection Agency adopts the ""behavioral law"". In the absence of specific evidence (decibels detected by scientific instruments), ""noise"" tickets can be issued. Therefore, it is proposed to include the ""noise"" of the exhaust pipe into the compulsory inspection item, and to discuss whether the behavior of New Taipei\'s ""administrative announcement"" without ""proof"" involves illegality.', 'Household karaoke loudspeaker equipment noise. After being reported, the competent authority requested to actively improve the sound insulation equipment.1. Household karaoke loudspeaker noise belongs to the neighborhood noise, which is difficult to measure, especially the low-frequency vibration emitted by the subwoofer, which disturbs the general public unbearably. Singing outside the control time cannot be fined under the noise control law. In the social order maintenance law, three households must provide evidence to punish the disturbance of peace. However, due to the terrain, the noise will only affect one household, and it will never be developed. 2. The current competent authority for noise in the neighborhood is the police agency, and hopes to return to the environmental protection agency. As long as the public reports the noise, and the inspectors arrive at the scene and find that the sound of the amplifying equipment is indeed affecting the peace, there is no need to conduct noise measurements. They can request that the sound insulation equipment be improved within a time limit. After the improvement, the inspector will review it.']"

Proposal content 1. According to the first paragraph of Article 22, Item 1, Subparagraph 5 of the Food Safety and Hygiene Management Law: ""The name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer or domestic responsible manufacturer"", and Article 22, Item 4 expressly stipulates that ""If only the name of the domestic responsible manufacturer is marked in Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 5, the name, telephone number and address of the manufacturer, entrusted manufacturer, or importer shall be notified to the competent authority in the jurisdiction; the competent authority shall open it to other competent authorities for common inspection."" 2. Regarding the above-mentioned decrees, the legislators are concerned that international laws and regulations do not have strict requirements on food labeling to indicate the manufacturing plant and manufacturer. In order to avoid import traders from incurring a large amount of input costs due to the special requirements of the national laws and regulations, this decree follows the spirit of international legislation. Only the domestic responsible manufacturer or the manufacturer or both can be marked on the outer packaging of the food. Third, due to the frequent circulation of food safety storms, the Chinese people worry that the government has loopholes in food safety management. However, considering the health and safety of the people and the spirit of national supervision, it should jointly crack down on illegal food industry. The first law of law enables illegal operators to make food through underground factories, processing, packaging, and food. SO International Certification and other issues allow the public to only buy products when purchasing products. In addition, the decree only restricts that ""the competent authority should open other competent authorities to common inspection"" and does not open it to the public. However, this decree adopts the principle of non-disclosure to the public. Basically, the public does not know where and which factory the product is made of. The lack of public supervision mechanism intends to create a breach in food safety. 2. Suggestions Regarding this law, a mechanism for public inspection should be added and Taiwan production and manufacturing should be advertised. Products made in Taiwan should be strongly marked with the responsible manufacturer and manufacturing factory, so that the public can inquire, and it will also enable the whole people to monitor food safety and reduce the burden on public officials.', 'The Food and Drug Administration should formulate Chinese and English classification labels for vegetarian food (two standards and five categories), and design icons for manufacturers to use, making it easier for consumers to interpret product properties.1. The current ""Regulations on the Labeling of Packaged Foods Claiming to Be Vegetarian"" is confusing in terms of classification basis (see note), and lacks a unified English label. The so-called vegan is a product that does not contain any animal ingredients, but five spices can be eaten. However, the current ""Regulations on the Labeling of Packaged Foods Claiming to Be Vegetarian"" lists phytopentadol as an ingredient that can contain egg and milk, which is different from the definition of vegan. Vegetarian, which is commonly used by manufacturers, can contain dairy products by definition, but it is often used in vegan products. 2. As the proportion of vegetarians increases, both consumers and manufacturers need to have a clearer labeling system (including Chinese and English labels and icons) to avoid misinterpretation by consumers. 3. Classify vegetarian food in the way of ""Two Standards and Five Categories"", which is more in line with the needs of modern vegetarians/vegetarians. Using animal ingredients as the classification standard, and subdividing them into 2-3 categories (with icons) under the two standards will enable consumers to clearly and quickly judge the nature of the product. (1) No animal ingredients Vegan 1. Vegan: pure plant ingredients, no products containing five spices. 2. Five pungent: pure plant ingredients, products containing five pungent. (2) Contains animal ingredients Vegetarian1. Lacto: products containing animal milk. 2. Egg element: products containing animal eggs. 3. Vegetarian: products containing animal milk and eggs. (3) Any product called vegetarian shall not contain animal meat, bone, blood, fur or other ingredients. Note: The Department of Health of the Executive Yuan announced the ""Regulations on the Labeling of Packaged Food Claiming to be Vegetarian"" on July 1, 1997, and it will be implemented on July 1, 1998 (based on the date of manufacture). For packaged foods that claim to be vegetarian, words such as ""Vegan or Vegan"", ""Ovo Vegetarian"", ""Lacto Vegetarian"", ""Lacto Ovo Vegetarian"" and ""Vegetarian Vegetarian"" should be clearly marked on the package. The definitions of the terms marked are as follows: 1. Vegetarian or vegan: pure plant foods that do not contain the five spices of plants (scallions, garlic, leeks, buckwheat and xingqu). 2. Egg vegetarian: vegan or vegan and egg products. 3. Lacto-vegetarian: vegan or vegan and dairy products. 4. Lacto-egg vegetarian: vegan or vegan and milk and egg products.

In view of the frequent occurrence of food safety storms in Taiwan, people in the country are worried about whether the government needs to manage food safety and hygiene. However, it has been verified that Articles 22 and 24 of the Food Safety and Hygiene Management Law stipulate that the legislator adopts a self-reporting model for food labeling only [domestic responsible manufacturers], so that the industry can report the manufacturer and its information to the local competent authority in a self-disciplined manner in accordance with the law, so that the local competent authority can create a file on the system for other subjective agencies to query. However, the disclosure of government information and the unification of various laws and regulations should be considered, and it should be open to the public to inquire about the name of the manufacturer. This book is not a business secret, and should not be classified as confidential. It is also a legal commodity. Article 9 of the Product Labeling Law can be done very well. For imports, producers, and license manufacturers, the name of the manufacturer should be marked. The quality of the product also allows the public to jointly supervise the manufacturer. In addition, the Medical Device Management Law and the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law also stipulate that the manufacturer should be marked on the packaging of the product (Article 33 of the Medical Device Management Law, Article 75 of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and Article 20 of the Drug Inspection and Registration Review Guidelines). The spirit of supervision, the standards for jointly cracking down on unscrupulous and unscrupulous food companies, is open to public inquiries, so as to prevent unscrupulous operators from taking advantage of this loophole to avoid government inspections (lack of manpower), lack of public supervision, and cause Taiwanese people to eat unscrupulous food, resulting in breaches in food safety. 4. Item 4 of Article 8 of the Food Safety and Hygienic Management Law has legislated to require food to be registered as a food business with the local competent authority in accordance with the food business registration method, also known as non-registration, so that it can be put on the shelves through food and medicine, and food businesses continue to register one after another. However, the registered businesses are limited to the manufacturing and processing industry, catering industry, import industry, sales industry, and logistics industry. However, consideration should be given to the public. This page only has the name, address, and registration number of the business, and lacks product information. In addition, manufacturers in Articles 22 and 24 of the Food Safety and Sanitation Management Law should be able to follow this method and require the manufacturer\'s information to be registered in the product and open to public inquiries.']"

First of all: The focus of the proposal to prevent false information is to suggest that the government adopt three directions: supervising Internet platform operators to abide by self-discipline, regularly evaluating the management mechanism of Internet platforms, and preventing false information from being incorporated into the civil defense system. The main purpose of the proposal to amend the Three Laws on Broadcasting and TV is to prevent the broadcast media from reporting false or harmful news, and manipulating the volume of the media to violate news ethics. How does this relate to preventing false information on the Internet?

The media is a check and balance force in addition to the three powers of the executive, legislative and judicial powers. The freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and dissemination. This right cannot be undermined by unilateral interference by the executive power, that is, the content of media broadcasts cannot be restricted by administrative measures. The government cannot pre-censor the content of media reports in any form and for any reason. Therefore, the case does not enter secondment. Here I would like to ask the government: Use the name of freedom of speech to gradually harm speech and the democratic system. Is this a part of the democratic system? This is why the concept of ""defensive democracy"" is very much needed in the Republic of China and the reason for reviewing and amending the law: spreading false information and hate speech to confuse and divide the masses. Even if they report to the police, the legal system can prevent such behavior. The government should rethink whether the existing mechanism is effective?

Credibility has led to the dissemination of fake news, and even the death of an outstanding diplomat. It is necessary to re-examine the tolerance of press freedom, and we must not allow unscrupulous media and reporters to abuse press freedom to cause social and political turmoil. It is suggested that, while protecting the right of media broadcasting and freedom of the press, reconsider the imposition of high fines and administrative penalties for false reports, falsified news and exclusives, embezzled facts, or reports with provocative headlines that do not match the content. Suggestions are as follows: 1. Legislate to add or increase penalties and fines for the exclusive and first broadcast media that make false reports, and to allow continuous penalties. It is suggested that the click-through rate, sharing rate, and reprint rate of other media can be used as the standard for fines. Other reprinted media, as accomplices, are ordered to publicly apologize to the Chinese people within three days on the front page of the Internet newspaper, the front page or cover of the paper media, and the first broadcast of the media. 2. Regularly publish the number of false reports by various media, and directly withdraw the license and forcibly dissolve the company for the media with the most false reports in the year. 3. Regularly announce the number of times the journalists belonging to each media have written false reports, and the top three reporters with the most false reports in the year can be directly disqualified as reporters. For journalists who misuse and reprint Internet news to spread falsehoods, the same shall be done.']"

Now I am going to a kindergarten. Although I want to have two children, the initial cost of starting a family is a lot. Childcare loans at interest rates to alleviate the financial needs in the early stages of starting a family, combined with other incentives for childcare subsidies and measures to encourage childbirth, and strongly recommend that the national childcare allowance should be unified; distance is to increase the public childcare rate before the age of 6', 'The government is requested to plan to set the policy of ""partial reduction and exemption of people\'s livelihood (public) consumption"" according to the ""number of children born in a household"".The government has always been aware that the declining birthrate and aging population are not only hidden dangers for national development, but have even begun to appear in crisis in some areas (for example: pension application), so the government proposes to formulate relevant policies to deal with the declining birthrate at the ""national security level"". Over the past ten years, visible relevant policies have been proposed: maternity subsidies, childcare subsidies, labor, (public, national) childcare subsidies of various local governments, childcare leave without pay, and increased comprehensive tax exemptions. After setting the tone of the argument that ""fewer births are a national security issue,"" local governments have also increased maternity subsidies depending on their financial conditions, and lower-level townships and cities have also proposed their own versions of ""increased rewards"" if their financial conditions permit. However, statistics show that since 2020, my country has experienced a death cross between fertility and mortality, that is, the birth rate is lower than the death rate for the first time, which means that the total number of people in our country has begun to decrease. The national crisis brought about by such a changing trend is: the reduction of national productivity, the decline of overall consumption ability, the increase of medical expenses caused by the aging of the people, the imbalance of annuity payment conditions (fewer people pay, more people receive), etc., the impact of the decline in fertility rate and even an aging society can be seen in general. But in terms of trends, why does the birth rate continue to decline after the government has proposed various subsidies and incentives? When exploring the reasons for the declining birth rate, everyone refers to economic factors, such as ""how can I raise children if I can\'t make money?"", ""how can I raise children when prices are so expensive?"" However, based on the analysis of the current existing policies: maternity subsidies, labor, (public, state) maternity allowances can only be subsidies received in the nature of rewards, and the actual income is far from enough to buy diapers and milk powder for children, let alone the long process of raising children. Childcare subsidies can indeed solve the urgent needs of young double-income couples. The reduction of the comprehensive income tax exemption can only be happy once a year, and the childcare leave without pay must also worry about whether there will be suitable job vacancies after the expiration. From the perspective of policy marketing, the government certainly has good intentions, but it does not seem very attractive. ""How can I raise a child if I can\'t make money?"", ""How can I raise a child if the price is so expensive?"", ""Raising a child costs money for everything,,,"", judging from the concerns of these young parents, the real reason why they dare not have children is the bit by bit, the constant economic pressure. There are too many internal and external factors that affect the country\'s economic conditions, and it is not possible to feel it for a while; but it can be felt all the time and deeply to reduce the financial pressure of young parents. If public resources can be converted into long-term and sustainable ""living allowances"", that is, young parents can think that my household expenditure ratio will be reduced after giving birth to children; I can actually feel the economic benefits of having children every month, so that I can truly increase my willingness to have children from the source.', ""Please modify the countermeasures against childcare for children under the age of 2: the quasi-public mechanism for childcare, and the provision that childcare subsidies and childcare allowances cannot be claimed at the same time in the expanded childcare allowance policyThe new system from August 1, 2017 stipulates that if you apply for a childcare subsidy of up to 6,000 yuan, you cannot apply for a childcare subsidy. The government said that 6,000 yuan is more than 2,500 yuan, which is good for the people. That's right, 6,000 yuan is more than 2,500 yuan. The problem is that 8,500 yuan (2,500 yuan childcare allowance + 6,000 yuan childcare subsidy) is not more than 6,000 yuan? Why does the new system stipulate that after claiming childcare subsidy, you can no longer claim childcare subsidy? 1. The government itself also said that childcare subsidy and childcare subsidy are different in nature. Since the nature is different, why is it forbidden to apply for it at the same time? 2. Is it true that kindergartens help parents take care of their children 24 hours a day? How many families do not take care of their children after work? How many families do not take care of their children after work? This is not considered childcare? Can’t receive childcare allowances? 3. The policy stipulates that childcare expenses should be controlled at 10-15% of the family’s disposable income (about 8,000 to 12,000 yuan), in order to substantially reduce the burden on parents. 19,927 yuan per month, after deducting the original childcare allowance + childcare subsidy, it barely reaches 11,427 yuan.

How to implement the plan Each high school can refer to the teaching evaluation questionnaire of each university and slightly modify the differences between high school and university education in the questionnaire; every school year, each school or the competent education authority should conduct counseling or review for teachers with unsatisfactory evaluation results; if teachers are found to violate the law in the answers to the questionnaire, they should immediately report to the competent authority and impose corresponding punishments according to the severity of the circumstances. At the same time, the competent authority can also legalize this idea and formulate rules or measures to make the teaching situation more balanced and students can receive education in a good educational environment.

Relevant norms: The norms of the smoking area can follow Article 16, Item 3 of the Tobacco Hazard Prevention Law: 1. The smoking area should be clearly marked. 2. The area of \u200b\u200bthe smoking area shall not be larger than half of the outdoor area of \u200b\u200bthe place, and shall not be located in places that must be passed. However, in order to cope with the comprehensive ban on smoking, you can consider adding the third and fourth paragraphs: 3. A smoking area must be set up every N meters in public areas such as streets. 4. A cigarette butt collection place must be set up in the smoking area.', 'Set up smoking halls and restricted smoking places to reduce the conflict of opinions between smokers and non-smokersSmoking has irreparable and significant damage to the body, but smokers hardly ask ""all"" people who may be affected, so for many people, the ""right to harm"" is in the hands of smokers. According to the Constitution and laws, people have freedom as long as they do not violate the rights of others, cause social harm, and are legal. If the smoker asks, it will affect everyone who is affected, of course OK, but the smokers I have met now include smoking while walking on the road, smoking while riding a motorcycle, smoking while driving, smoking at a fixed point, smoking in neighbors, someone smoking in the toilet in the campus before, soldiers, officers and soldiers smoking. You can still smell the door and windows, and the smell of smoke will not only linger on your body and clothing, but also on some items. I could be fine with the smoke (but still very uncomfortable and very tired) or I could have an immediate (within half a second) headache, heartache, lung pain, sore eyes, skin and neck ailments, a feeling of erosion in my throat (so maybe a cough). Of course, many smokers would like to open up smoking everywhere, and many non-smokers would like to ban smoking everywhere or even list it as a drug. So I came up with a solution: 1. Set up one or more ""smoke halls"" (or other names) in townships, towns, and municipalities directly under the central government. One can be set up in each military and security barracks. Deodorizing equipment roughly removes the smell of smoke and harmful substances from clothing. 2. Fill in a ""smoke island"". In addition to smoking, it can be used as a sightseeing island with the theme of smoking. The number of smoke is controlled at the entrance and exit, and the smoke smell and harmful substances on some clothes can be reduced by blowing or other methods near the exit. Except for ""Smoke House"" and ""Smoke Island"" or other specific places with special planning where smoking is allowed, smoking and buying and selling of tobacco products are completely prohibited in other places.', 'Set up smokehouses and restricted smoking places to reduce the conflict of opinions between smokers and non-smokers1. Smoking does irreparable and significant damage to the body. 2. It is normal for the smell of smoke to float more than 10 meters when there is no wind, and the wind often blows to 20 meters (see the wind direction for luck). Even if the neighbor next door smokes, you can still smell it even if you close the door and window. The smell of smoke will not only remain on the body and clothing, but also on some items. 3. According to the Constitution and the law, people have freedom under the law, without violating the rights of others, and without causing social harm, but smokers hardly go around and ask ""all"" people who may be affected, so for many people, this ""right to harm"" is in the hands of smokers. If the smoker gets the consent of all the affected people, of course it is OK, but the smokers I have encountered so far include smoking while walking on the road, smoking while riding a bicycle, smoking while driving, smoking at fixed points, or smoking in neighbors, smoking in the toilets on campus, smoking in military sergeants... No one will ask ""everyone affected"" whether they agree or not. 4. Some people will experience symptoms immediately after inhaling second-hand smoke, such as: headache, heartache, lung pain, sore eyes, sore throat, throat inflammation, cough... 5. Many smokers want to open smoking everywhere, and many non-smokers want to ban smoking everywhere and even list it as a drug (someone once proposed it). 6. Even though the current law stipulates, there are still illegal activities, and many of them are not punished, perhaps because it is difficult to obtain evidence or report trouble, or it is simply not known who the smoke is coming from. I figured out a way: 1. Set up a ""smoking place"" (tentative, can be renamed). (1) Buying and selling tobacco products and smoking. (2) The smell of smoke and harmful substances shall be treated in a concentrated manner so as not to leak out. 2. Construct a ""smoke island"": (1) It has the function of ""smoke house"". (2) It is a sightseeing island with the theme of smoke. (3) The number of smoke is controlled at the entrance and exit, and blowing or other methods are used near the exit to reduce the smoke smell and harmful substances on some clothes. Except for ""tobacco shop"" and ""tobacco island"" or other specific places with special planning where smoking is allowed, smoking and buying and selling of tobacco products are completely prohibited in other places. ""Smoke House"" is the main thing, and ""Smoke Island"" is optional.']"
40,39,64,39_106_pbl_109_107,"['106', 'pbl', '109', '107', 'ii', '108', '77', 'iii', '20', '00']","['High School Joins PBL Program希望教育部能將PBL課程成為高中各校上課模式 PBL的定義：PBL(Problem-Based Learning)問題導向學習法指的是透過問題或情境誘發學生思考，並建立學習目標，學生進行自我導向式研讀，增進新知或修正舊有的知識內容。PBL不只能夠解決問題，在處理問題的同時，也是我們精進知識的最佳時機。 PBL課程中學生應具備的技巧與態度 1.團隊合作 2.文獻選讀 3.主持團隊學習活動 4.自我導向學習與教學資源利用 5.傾聽 6.課堂報告 7.記錄 8.合作 9.尊重成員意見 10.呈現學習成果 小組式學習的好處不只是可以來增進知識，同時也可以促進溝通技巧、團隊合作、解決問題、自主學習、資訊分享、以及訓練團隊成員彼此尊重。因此， PBL 被視為是結合知識獲取以及培養技巧與態度的學習方式。通常 PBL 實施的背景是核心課程必須已經清楚界定，且基礎與臨床學科已經密切地整合。 PBL的四個要點 一、漸進累積的學習：在任何時刻，學習都應該是無限制，無止境；當然也不是重複同樣的東西。 二、整合式學習：學科不應該被拆開，而是以是否相關為取捨的準則。 三、留心學習進展：當學生的知識成長，則課程應該要跟著有所改變。 四、學習的一致性：課程的安排應該全面性的貫徹 PBL 的精神。 PBL的教學 PBL教學方式有很多種。以馬斯垂克的七級跳步驟 (Maastricht seven jump process)為例。 一、典型的PBL教學會有一組學生(通常8到10個)和一位老師。 二、組員需花時間熟悉彼此，培養團隊默契。 三、在某情境當中，學生選出一位主席，一位記錄將記錄討論內容。 四、每個團隊成員在不同的情境扮演不同的角色。 五、在每堂討論開始時，可以由主席將情境唸出來或是所有的學生來研讀所分配的情境資料。 六、如果所分配的情境是病房的病人，則可以由一個學生負責詢問病史並進行物理檢查，然後整組進入教室。 七、每堂課分發每位學生PBL手冊，手冊內容涵蓋情境資料以及相關學習資源。 PBL教學步驟 一、辨識並澄清情境中不熟悉的術語，並一一記錄下來。 二、擬定需討論的議題。對此學生彼此可能會有不同的觀點，可一一討論，如果大家都同意者則納入議程。 三、腦力激盪，以既有的知識來提供可能的解釋；彼此互相討論，找出彼此知識不足之處，將所有討論記錄下來。 四、重新回顧第二與第三步驟，找出可能的解決之道，將解決之道組織並重新整理。 五、擬定學習目標，組員間達成學習目標的共識，老師確認小組的學習目標切合實際，完整且適當。 六、個別研讀(每位學生針對學習目標蒐集資料)。 七、小組共同分享研讀的成果；老師監督學習成效並評估整組的表現。 教師的角色是來導引討論的進行(協助主席維持團隊討論動力，並督導工作的進行)，確認團隊討論確實符合課程的學習目標。教師必須在PBL第七步驟扮演更主動的角色，確認學生確實完成功課，輔導小組呈現學習成果；教師並鼓勵學生檢討是否完全了解，鼓勵學生問問題，並彼此互相解釋所學。 教師常會覺得得把學生帶回正確的路途，所以教師必須時時壓制控制團隊討論的衝動。控制的做法會讓學生感覺解決問題不是他們的責任，反正只要老師在場，則任何問題都自有解決之道。 設計PBL情境 PBL情境設計的品質夠好，PBL教學才可能成功。如何設計有效率的PBL學習情境？ 一、研讀情境後學生制訂的學習目標應與學校訂定的學習目標相符。 二、問題導向學習的問題應該與課程的階段性目標與學生理解能力相匹配。 三、情境應該相當地符合學生學習的興趣所在或者與未來的環境相關 。 四、在臨床情境中應該觸及基礎課程相關領域來鼓勵知識的整合。 五、情境應該含有能夠刺激討論的要點，鼓勵學生尋求解決的方法。 六、問題應該是開放式的，以利討論的進行。 七、情境的設計應該能夠提高學生的參與度，讓學生從不同的學習資源分頭尋找資訊。 PBL教師的責任 一、詢問開放性的問題，幫助學生了解狀況，並開發他們思考方式。 二、幫助學生反思自身經驗，開發專業技巧，提昇解決問題的能力，促進學習。 三、監督進展，注意思路可以有效地解決問題，確使不離題，且確定解決問題仍在進行。監視進度是有效解決問題重要的一環。 四、批判性思考，思考會更加深入，尋求意義，鍛煉批判性思考的習慣。 五、提醒必須討論的課題。據調查，沒有老師在旁的組別常常只會討論到必須探討的議題的60%。 教師的發展與成長 其實，將PBL引進教學課程老師的負擔會加重：從原先只是提供知識傳遞的角色，現在必須在小組學習當中扮演引導的角色。因此，老師必須有所成長，擔任 PBL 課程的教師必須擁有 PBL 的技巧，也就是能夠幫助 PBL 的的進行並管理團隊學習與討論動力。學校應該提供老師相關教學策略與課程安排原則，這樣老師才能夠幫助學生理解學習目標，另外也亦一併說明評量方式，另外應針對學生的焦慮等情緒與不適應情形應安排特定時段來輔導學生。 PBL評量 學生的學習受到評量方式相當程度的影響。如果評量形式只是要求學生記憶片斷性事實，PBL課程是不可能成功的。評量應該遵照課程基本原則與課程目標來設計，採取一系列不同的評估方式。PBL小組中學生的活動與表現也可以列入評估。評估方式可以由老師打分數或是針對學生的實際操作表現來給分。另外，也就整組表現來評分：當組員依照 PBL 方式討論，溝通技巧良好，彼此尊重，都應該給予加分。這樣學生會有來自同儕的壓力，使得組員不敢鬆懈，而且給整組表現打分使得學生願意遵循 PBL 的模式與規則來盡力學習與表現。 ◎資料來 源:https://m.xuite.net/blog/kc6191/study/16066307 ', 'In order to allow the government to fairly deal with the

來、我們可以叫父親喝酒、與他同寢。這樣、我們好從他存留後裔。 於是那夜他們叫父親喝酒、大女兒就進去和他父親同寢。 他幾時躺下、幾時起來、父親都不知道。 第二天、大女兒對小女兒說、我昨夜與父親同寢、今夜我們再叫他喝酒、你可以進去與他同寢。 這樣、我們好從父親存留後裔。 於是那夜他們又叫父親喝酒、小女兒起來與他父親同寢。他幾時躺下、幾時起來、父親都不知道。這樣，羅得的兩個女兒都從他父親懷了孕。 大女兒生了兒子，給他起名叫摩押，就是現今摩押人的始祖。小女兒也生了兒子，給他起名叫便亞米，就是現今亞捫人的始祖。──創世紀19:30-38 早前中大學生報中只是兩句沒有直接描述性行為的「你會不會幻想過同阿爸阿媽兄弟姐妹做愛？」及「鼓吹亂倫，評為不雅刊物。聖經這般描述肯定不止鼓吹亂倫，還企圖把亂倫合理化、正常化！而且有關經文還仔細描述參與亂倫的人脈關係、參與人數、對話及地點，意識嚴重不良。 把女兒推給別人強姦 除了亂倫，《聖經》還描述這個義人為了保護家中的客人，竟把自己兩個親女兒送給別人強姦(創世紀19:5-8)。這被稱為唯一義人的行為實在令人側目，亦嚴重扭曲今天我們社會共同接受與遵守的人倫關係，利用子女對父母的信心作出禽獸不如的性侵犯，與社會大眾打擊兒童性侵犯的努力背道而馳！ 把妾士推給別人強姦致死然後再碎屍 「 我有個女兒、還是處女、並有這人的妾、我將他們領出來任憑你們玷辱他們、只是向這人不可行這樣的醜事。 那些人卻不聽從他的話．那人就把他的妾拉出去交給他們、他們便與他交合、終夜凌辱他、直到天色快亮纔放他去。 天快亮的時候、婦人回到他主人住宿的房門前、就仆倒在地、直到天亮。 早晨、他的主人起來開了房門、出去要行路、不料那婦人仆倒在房門前、兩手搭在門檻上。 就對婦人說、起來、我們走罷．婦人卻不回答。那人便將他馱在驢上、起身回本處去了。 到了家裡、用刀將妾的屍身切成十二塊、使人拿著傳送以色列的四境。」 ──士師記19:24-29 雖然電影《人肉叉燒包》以真正發生過的謀殺案件作為主題，但由於內容涉及血腥和暴力，所以被評為第三級，依法禁止發布予未滿十八歲的人士。上面引述的《聖經》章節，其血腥及暴力程度與《人肉叉燒包》相若。若按照同一的標準，以上的經文實屬不雅、過份血腥及暴力，理應依法禁止發布予未滿十八歲人士。 耶和華使女子赤露下體 「 耶和華又說、因為錫安的女子狂傲、行走挺項、賣弄眼目、俏步徐行、腳下玎璫． 所以主必使錫安的女子頭長禿瘡、耶和華又使他們赤露下體。 」 ──以賽亞書3:16-17 吃糞便 「 你喫這餅、像喫大麥餅一樣、要用人糞在眾人眼前燒烤。 耶和華說、以色列人在我所趕他們到的各國中、也必這樣喫不潔淨的食物。 我說、哎、主耶和華阿、我素來未曾被玷污、從幼年到如今沒有喫過自死的、或被野獸撕裂的、那可憎的肉也未曾入我的口。 於是他對我說、看哪、我給你牛糞代替人糞、你要將你的餅烤在其上。 」 ──以西結書4:12-15 吃人肉[編輯] 「 我就說、我不牧養你們．要死的、由他死．要喪亡的、由他喪亡．餘剩的、由他們彼此相食。 」 ──撒迦利亞11:9  「 在你中間父親要吃兒子、兒子要吃父親、我必向你施行審判、我必將你所剩下的、分散四方。〔方原文作風〕 」 ──以西結書5:10 附件: A. 殘害兒童：列王記下 2:23 - 2:24／詩篇 137: 9／創世紀 22:2-

對第一線基層管理人員攻擊毆打、穢語辱罵、恐嚇威脅、誣控濫告之事件發生。 經查司法院網站判決書目前受刑人對攻擊毆打監獄管理人員的判刑太輕很少超過5個月刑期。  受刑人對於依法執行公務的監獄管理人員實施攻擊毆打、穢語辱罵、恐嚇威脅都是屬於妨害公務的行為矯正機關有義務函送地檢署法辦。但矯正機關長官人員因某些特殊因素考量並未將施暴受刑人函送地檢署法辦，犧牲第一線基層監所管理人員依法執行職務之威信、尊嚴，縱容受刑人之惡行。  至於誣控濫告部分，本人就曾經遭受受刑人四次向地檢署濫告而受訴累之苦， 官司進行期間機關長官不聞不問未曾提供協助，依據當時法務部頒發監獄受刑人違規情節及懲罰參考標準表，誣控濫告符合辦理違規懲罰要件，因此本人自行寫狀紙向地檢署聲請官司不起訴的結案證明，拿著官司不起訴的結案證明去向監獄長官請求將受刑人辦理違規，但監獄長官居然縱容受刑人不辦違規(裁量權限縮至零)，本人因長期受訴訟之累及長官縱容受刑人對我濫告之怒目前情緒障礙看診服藥中。  法務部矯正署對於監獄管理人員遭受受刑人攻擊毆打、穢語辱罵、恐嚇威脅、誣控濫告的件數從未公布。因此本人自行至司法院網站判決書查詢相關資料，為了避免案件重複計算所以只有查詢地方法院的判決書(不含上訴)，經查106年至110年(不含誣控濫告) 合計88件次，所得資料整理如下：  1臺北地方法院 107 年度審簡字第 1830 號施以強暴徒刑3月 2新北地方法院 110 年度簡字第 3131

Euthanasia is based on the consent of the patient and the patient\'s family members, and after the professional assessment by the medical team confirms that the patient is truly incapable of physical and psychological pain, the patient can request the medical team to administer medicine, give up medical emergency aid, or the medical team can prescribe medicine to allow the patient to die with dignity. The patient\'s life is not randomly taken for no reason, and euthanasia is performed at will without the patient\'s knowledge. (Definition of terms) 2. At present, my country\'s criminal law still has the provisions of ""homicide"" and ""processing suicide"", which have not been revised. It is still not allowed to use various ""euthanasia"" methods by patients, patients\' family members, and medical teams to end the patient\'s life early. The draft amendment to the ""Patients\' Autonomy Law"" requires those who want to pursue ""euthanasia"" to spend transportation expenses to go to other countries for euthanasia, causing their inconvenience. For example: Fu Daren, a famous former sports news anchor in our country, had to go to Switzerland for euthanasia in order to achieve his goal. 3.

To know the importance of euthanasia, you must first understand the purpose of euthanasia. The implementation of euthanasia lies in the fact that terminally ill patients are unable to recover, and will endure unbearable pain, and let them die painlessly. This not only allows people to walk with dignity, but also allows the right to life to be extended to decide death in addition to living. Currently, the promotion of euthanasia in Taiwan is extremely slow. Usually, the government agencies give the following responses: 1. Taiwan currently has passive euthanasia. For the terminally ill, there are already regulations on palliative and palliative care, which can be used to pre-establish palliative care and life-sustaining medical care. The law allows doctors to legally terminate the patient’s life-support equipment or remove emergency equipment. And that (passivity) is the problem. Such as: Fu Daren. Go abroad, just for euthanasia. And this is not a small fee. Is it the right of the rich to choose how to end their own lives? 2. Active euthanasia is already under discussion. The answer is the same every time, and there will be no results if you do it carelessly. Whether there is a consensus in the society, the government agencies only rely on subjective judgments, and have not really promoted it to let the people of Taiwan know that they still have the right to choose to die well. What should we do 1. Use the power of the Internet to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on the government and speed up the process of the bill. 2. Share this proposal to let more people know the importance of legal euthanasia. 3. I think that euthanasia should be included in the curriculum to strengthen people\'s understanding of euthanasia.

Nationals of the Republic of China who have reached the age of 14 can apply for the driving license of ordinary light motorcycles (hereinafter referred to as light motorcycles). In recent years, due to the rise of electric bicycles (hereinafter referred to as electric bicycles), many traffic problems have arisen. The danger for car drivers is increased, and most electric vehicles on the road have a speed exceeding the legal speed of 25 kilometers per hour, and the weight of an electric vehicle must not exceed 40 kg. Driving at high speed, lighter motorcycles are dangerous. Light motorcycles are generally heavier, and because of the engine, the crankshaft of the engine has a moment of inertia, which makes driving much more stable. In addition, light motorcycles are equipped with suspension systems and lamps, which are more secure than electric vehicles. In addition, the power of light motorcycles is mainly controlled by the accelerator. Vigorous, safe starting. The handlebar of electric bicycles is controlled by electronic signals. With just a slight turn, the torque is released instantly, which may cause the vehicle to fly, causing danger. Most of the unlicensed driving groups are teenagers. Riding age, then why not consider opening up the choice of light motorcycles that are safer, more secure, and more stable for young people to replace electric bicycles that do not require licenses, number plates, and compulsory insurance? Adding road tests can make driving safer, improve technology, and make light motorcycle drivers safer. Driving attitude and skills depend on the individual. And let young people who are willing to commute by bike can live a convenient life (the white card is still 18 years old, because the power is greater and safety considerations)"", 'For electric bicycle users, implement age restrictions and strengthen publicity and education on traffic safety and regulationsIn view of the popularity of electric self-assisted bicycles and electric bicycles, such convenient means of transportation can frequently be seen shuttled back and forth in the streets and alleys. However, under such popularity, accidents often occur. Compared with automobiles and motorcycles, electric bicycles do not need to obtain a driver\'s license to drive, as long as you buy it, you can go on the road; and after passing the automobile license test, you still need to pass a safety traffic publicity course before you can get a driver\'s license. In contrast, electric bicycles can go on the road without any license examination process or listening to traffic safety and law courses. Furthermore, there is no age limit for the use of electric bicycles. It can be said that as long as you own an electric vehicle, you can become an electric bicycle driver. This aspect is also related to the driving safety of users. If teenagers and elderly people accidentally have accidents while riding electric bicycles, the injuries behind them will be unimaginable. Based on the above reasons, I hope to put forward the following two suggestions: (1) Restrict the riding age of electric bicycles This proposal will restrict users who are younger than 14 years old and higher than 75 years old to ensure their driving safety. The fourteen-year-old age limit is based on the consideration that middle school students generally commute to school. The school district for students at the elementary school level is generally near their home, but the school district at the elementary school level is farther away than the elementary school level, and middle school students are more likely to need relatively long commuting time, so it is hoped that the minimum age for use will be set at 14 years old. The age standard for the elderly is recommended to be set at 75 years old, which is based on the consideration of Taiwan\'s aging society and the 75 years old set by the current government\'s ""Research on the Driver\'s License Management System for Senior Drivers"". It is hoped that through age regulation, the chance of accidents will be reduced. (2) Strengthen traffic education and publicity on laws and regulations for users. It is hoped that when buying electric vehicles, buyers and possible users of the vehicles must first pass a certain number of hours of traffic safety publicity courses and after-school tests before they can use the vehicles. Electric bicycle users themselves are obliged to have the traffic safety knowledge and laws related to electric vehicles, and if a driving dispute occurs in the future, the accident parties (electric bicycle users) also need to accept a certain number of hours of traffic safety publicity before they can continue to use electric bicycles.', 'Incorporate electric bicycles into the scope of small light electric vehicles (the license plate number is in red letters on a white background)The shape and auxiliary functions of electric bicycles are no different from ordinary motorcycles or electric motorcycles, except that the maximum driving speed is less than 25 kilometers per hour, and the vehicle weight (excluding batteries) is less than 40 kilograms. However, due to the scope of bicycles, this type of vehicle only needs to display a certificate of conformity and does not need a license plate number. There is no third liability insurance, and it is easy to generate liability and compensation issues. It is suggested that electric bicycles should be included in the scope of small light electric vehicles (the license plate number is red on a white background). (2) Electric bicycle: refers to a two-wheeled vehicle that has passed the type inspection, mainly uses electric power, has a maximum driving speed of less than 25 kilometers per hour, and has a vehicle weight (excluding batteries) of less than 40 kilograms.

Manufacturers set their own rules to give discounts to the public after consumption. They even have to bind mobile payment to enjoy the discounts. It is not like consumer coupons that allow the public to choose the merchants they want to consume. In fact, when going to general stores for consumption, most of the merchants did not actively provide information about promotional coupons to the public, and the promotion of promotional coupons was not very good. I have personally experienced that some restaurants mentioned promotion coupons on their official website, but when they actually went to the restaurant to eat, they did not take the initiative to inform any consumption information of promotion coupons when checking out. This point needs to be improved, so the usage rate is not as high as that of consumption coupons. Therefore, the government can provide consumer coupons to the public, which can stimulate consumption and help the economic downturn affected by the new crown pneumonia epidemic, so that people can consume independently without restrictions, and have a higher degree of freedom in consumption, which can further drive the recovery of the economy.', 'Revitalization coupons can give you 30% changeThe regulation that revitalization coupons cannot be changed will make ordinary people more willing to spend the coupons in chain stores to ""earn discounts"". However, what we launch should not be revitalization coupons for large stores, but to rejuvenate small stores. It is recommended to get 30% of the change for the revitalization coupon. For example, if you buy a 100 yuan item with a 500 yuan revitalization coupon, you can get 400 yuan x 30% = 120 yuan, and so on', 'Reduce the minimum denomination of the revitalization couponThe issuance of physical coupons for the revitalization coupons is four coupons of 500 yuan and five coupons of 200 yuan. The purpose of issuing revitalization coupons is to encourage people to consume to revitalize the economy. Considering the fact that the revitalization coupons do not give change, consumers tend to use the coupons to buy products with a higher amount and close to the face value. Therefore, for small vendors, convenience stores or small businesses with relatively low consumption amounts, the revitalization coupons are not very beneficial.

The National Health Insurance Department should provide community pharmacies with dispensing prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine. The government should also implement the ""separation of traditional Chinese medicine and medicine"" as soon as possible!1. Taiwan’s pharmacy manpower is abundant. Article 15 of the Pharmacist Law: “Pharmacist’s business is as follows: 1. Drug sales or management. 2. Drug dispensing. 3. Drug identification. 4. Supervision of drug manufacturing. The pharmacist who has reached the appropriate standard in Chinese medicine courses is appointed by the central competent authority in conjunction with the central education competent authority. Pharmacists may sell or manage a certain level of medical equipment. The scope and type of certain level of medical equipment mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the central competent authority.” According to the health and welfare annual report published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2014, the number of pharmacists in Taiwan has reached more than 33,000, and the average number of pharmacists per 10,000 population is as high as 14.2. .6, it is obvious that Taiwan\'s pharmaceutical manpower is abundant, and there is even a surplus phenomenon. Research by the National Institutes of Health also found that according to the current trend of pharmaceutical manpower supply, the supply will exceed the demand before 2018. According to statistics, there are more than 90% of pharmacists who have taken Chinese medicine courses to meet the appropriate standards and obtained certificates, and are allowed to practice Chinese medicine business, nearly 30,000! 2. Health insurance should pay community pharmacies to dispense TCM prescriptions. The business of pharmacists includes pharmaceutical care-related businesses such as drug dispensing. For pharmacists who are qualified to perform traditional Chinese medicine business, under the appropriate dispensing environment of good drug dispensing standards, the health insurance shall pay the community pharmacy for dispensing traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. This is the statutory business of pharmacists and their due right to work. However, in the past 103 years, the Central Health Insurance Administration refused to pay the special pharmacy for dispensing traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions on the grounds that the regulations and facilities were not complete. 3. The government should implement the separation of traditional Chinese medicine and medicine as soon as possible. Taiwan\'s national health insurance has been launched since 1995, and Western medicine has implemented the separation of medicine. After seeing a doctor, the public can bring the prescription to the pharmacy to dispense and receive the medicine, and the professional pharmacist will deliver the medicine, and explain the use method and precautions of the medicine, and can check whether there is any drug interaction or repeated medication through the cloud medical history, so as to thoroughly check the safety of the public\'s medication. However, Chinese medicine has been included in the payment since the establishment of the health insurance, but it has not yet been separated from medicine! On the surface, Chinese medicine practitioners have the right to make adjustments, but in fact, Chinese medicine doctors seldom engage in adjustments in person, and they are all done by counter price reviewers or work-student students. Sixty percent of Taiwanese people seek medical treatment or use both Chinese and Western medicine at the same time. Chinese medicine doctors do not understand the mechanism of Western medicine and cannot provide professional consultation when people take Chinese and Western medicine at the same time. Therefore, it has become a loophole in people\'s drug safety today! Taking courses related to statutory Chinese medicine will provide sufficient manpower for the implementation of Chinese medicine business. The government should implement the separation of Chinese medicine and medicine as soon as possible, and let professional pharmacists take care of the safety of medicines for the whole people.', 'In order to support the foundation of traditional Chinese medicine, the ""Chinese Medicine Technician"" certification exam will be held quickly1. The whole world is paying attention to Chinese herbal medicines, and only Taiwan is going backwards: The World Health Organization first published a global strategy for traditional medicine in 2002, calling on countries to pay attention to and formulate policies to manage traditional medicine; The goal of this global strategy is to integrate traditional and so-called complementary medicine services into health care services and self-health care, thereby promoting the health of all people. The WTO even has a definition for herbal medicines. Our traditional Chinese medicines all conform to the WTO definition. We don\'t pay attention to it, but the whole world does. 2. The Chinese medicine industry needs to be managed by special laws and personnel, and Chinese medicine must not be ""westernized""! For thousands of years, ""inheritors of traditional Chinese medicine"" have followed the traits of being gentle, courteous, thrifty, and inherited from master to apprentice. In today\'s world, Chinese and foreign people all want to achieve the effect of health care in the most natural and least side effect way, and ""Chinese medicine"" just meets these two basic standards. It is a pity that the management of traditional Chinese medicine in Taiwan at this stage, whether it is the personnel, definition, production process, packaging method, storage method, etc., is managed according to the standards of western medicine. This move is undoubtedly a sneak peek. It is important to know that the production of traditional Chinese medicine has its own specific standards and production processes, from authentic and seasonal collection, identification, trimming, processing, and slicing, to making pills, ointments, pills, powders, herbs, and decoctions. It must not be set by the process management of western medicine. 3. Due to the government\'s administrative laziness, the traditional Chinese medicine industry is about to go into history... The traditional Chinese medicine dealers taught by mentors and apprentices are limited by the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"". The problem is that the government has not followed Article 103 of the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"" to set up the teaching, testing, training, and use of the Chinese medicine industry. It has only allowed the Chinese medicine industry to gradually wither away, and young people who are interested in working in the Chinese medicine industry are not allowed to enter. As a result, the number of Chinese medicine pharmacies has been reduced from more than 15,000 in its heyday to more than 8,000, and the average age of the operators is 60 years old. The excellent traditional cultural assets of traditional Chinese medicine, which have been passed down for thousands of years, will be destroyed due to the government\'s administrative laziness and inaction. 4. It has been proved in 1946 that the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"" cannot produce professionals who are dedicated to the management of Chinese medicine 1. Article 28 of the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"" stipulates that the sales of Chinese medicines should be managed by Chinese medicine practitioners, or pharmacists or pharmacists who have taken Chinese medicine courses to an appropriate standard. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Health and Welfare by the end of 2014, the number of these two companies engaged in Chinese medicine sales was only 1,049. However, the operators privately stated that there are actually many operators born after 1993 who hired pharmacists to ""list"" their businesses. 2. The National Federation of Chinese Physician Associations of the Republic of China also believes that there are indeed too few manpower for pharmacists to invest in the Chinese medicine industry. Shi Chunquan, executive director of the Association of Chinese Medicine Physicians, pointed out that there are only 181 pharmacists serving in Chinese medicine clinics, accounting for only 0.46% of the number of pharmacists in Taiwan. Obviously, manpower of pharmacists cannot effectively inject Chinese medicine industry. 3. The erroneous revision of the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"" has opened the door for pharmacists to manage Chinese medicine for 46 years, but in fact the proportion of pharmacists involved in the professional Chinese medicine field is not ideal, and the delay in issuing licenses for Chinese medicine dealers has caused the Chinese medicine industry to face serious manpower gaps and empty windows! Even if the industry is willing to hire pharmacists to manage and manage Chinese medicine, most pharmacists are unwilling to invest. The reason for this is nothing more than salary and professional ability. As a result, the pharmaceutical talents cultivated under this formal system cannot meet the needs of the industry, leading to the decline of the Chinese medicine industry. This further proves that the government\'s so-called ""legal system"" itself has major deficiencies and cannot effectively cultivate talents with both Western and Chinese medicine majors. 5. It is hoped that the government will revise the ""Pharmaceutical Affairs Law"" quickly, and quickly conduct the certification of Chinese medicine professional management personnel-Chinese medicine technicians, so as to avoid the shortage of Chinese medicine talents. The examination system certified by the government is used to screen out truly dedicated and professional Chinese medicine talents. In order to allow such professionals to play a role, it is hoped that the government will have to follow the current list of Chinese medicine merchants for the scope of Chinese medicine technicians’ operation of Chinese medicine business. 6. In order to properly plan the Chinese medicine technician system and related norms, the competent authority should issue licenses and allow them to practice until one year and six months from the date when the various measures formulated by the central health and welfare authority are announced and implemented, so as to make up for the seriously aging Chinese medicine practitioners (according to statistics, over 60 years old) during the planning period. ). 7. For the long-term development and cultivation of traditional medicine, university departments should be set up based on the principle of ""teaching, testing, training, and application"". The differences between Chinese and Western medicine should be considered. The training courses of Chinese medicine should be included in the teaching hours of the actual working experience of Chinese medicine to offset the school\'s teaching hours.', 'In order to support the foundation of traditional Chinese medicine, the ""Chinese Medicine Technician"" certification exam will be held quickly1.

In terms of traffic control and driving safety, traffic control signals cannot count down at all, and as far as the setting rules of developed countries are concerned, traffic control signals prohibit any additional information other than the signal information. Here is the explanation as follows: When the signal does not have a countdown timer, when the light signal turns from red to green, the starting delay time is usually longer, but the longer starting delay time is conducive to the safety of the intersection, and it is also more capable of handling emergencies that may occur at the intersection at any time. Drivers should pay great attention to the traffic conditions at intersections no matter they stop at a red light or drive on the road, and keep an eye on other vehicles coming and going. Drivers should monitor all traffic conditions at the intersection while waiting for a red light. For example, pay attention to pedestrians crossing the road at all times, because pedestrians may encounter a red light while crossing the intersection and have not yet left the road. Also, be aware of emergency vehicles that may be approaching. Providing the number of seconds remaining at a red light may encourage drivers to concentrate on other unimportant things, such as swiping their phones. Drivers should fully obey traffic control signals, and should not provide other additional information to disrupt the basis for driving compliance. In addition, the countdown timer for traffic control signs does not comply with international road traffic standards, which may cause foreigners to have doubts about understanding, and even cause traffic accidents. Therefore, the countdown timer for traffic control signs should be completely abolished. The following two international regulations and standards illustrate that ""traffic countdown display"" is not allowed internationally: Convention on Road Signs and Signals (Vienna Convention): Most developed countries in Europe have joined this convention and signed it. Most developed countries in Europe have joined this convention to show their responsibility for international traffic, and there must be no signs, signs, or markings that foreigners cannot understand on road facilities (including traffic signs). Unless new measures are written into the Vienna Convention (member states can issue amendments), drivers must not be provided with substandard facilities and information. Since the driving countdown is not included in the Vienna Convention, this measure cannot be implemented in countries that are subject to the Vienna Convention. United States Road Traffic Management Signs Uniform Code (MUTCD): According to the US MUTCD 2009 specification, the second paragraph of Section 4D.06 (Paragraph 2 in Section 4D.06) clearly stipulates: ""Any font (letters) or numbers (including any countdown display, etc.) shall not be displayed as any part of the traffic control signal instructions. Letters or numbers (including those associated with countdown displays) shall not be displayed as part of a vehicular signal indication.” This standard has clearly stated that any additional information not related to the signal is prohibited. The reason why the United States does not allow the countdown display for driving is that I wrote to the US Department of Transportation in February last year and received an official response as follows: • There are a large number of Actuated signals (inductive signals) in the United States. Because this kind of signal is inductive, it is difficult or even impossible to know how many seconds it will change. • US Department of Transportation does not want drivers to turn off their engines while waiting at a red light. The department expects drivers to remain maneuverable and alert at all times so that in the event of any emergency at an intersection, the driver has the opportunity to be alert and flee. And the red light countdown sign may make the driver relax or even turn off the engine, and then be distracted from other things such as mobile phones. • The Department of Transportation in the US does not want the first car on the stop line to start first and hit the gas when it is about to change to green, ie the department wants to delay the start time. The department believes that extending the start delay time will bring safety to the intersection. When the signal turns green, drivers are also obliged to keep to the right to give way to any vehicles and pedestrians that were legally driving at the previous signal. The reason why most developed countries do not adopt the traffic control signal countdown timer or legislate to prohibit the traffic control signal countdown also has the following reasons: The length of the traffic control signal is not fixed, so it is impossible to count down naturally. Many countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have changed their signals to more advanced adaptive control (adaptive control) systems, so it is impossible to know when the signals will change. However, Taiwan is still stuck in the traditional pretimed control stage. Signal period is short. In most developed countries such as Europe, America and Japan, the signal cycle is short, and the length of the red light should not exceed 60 seconds in principle, and it is even less likely that there will be a special spectacle like Taiwan\'s 200-second red light. Therefore, it is recommended to completely cancel the countdown timer of the traffic control signal and return to the normal form of the signal.', 'Countdown to Total No-Traffic Traffic Control SignTraffic control signal countdown display (vehicle-specific signal countdown timer, now red light countdown) should be completely canceled and prohibited.

When many drivers see the intersection signal lights ahead displaying green lights, because they do not know when the front intersection signal lights will turn into red lights, they simply slow down and move forward. 2. Conversely, some drivers who drive the vehicle to the intersection see that the signal light ""suddenly"" changes from green to yellow, which will cause the driver to make an emergency brake, and then the rear vehicle will chase and collide. Suggestions: 1. After setting the countdown of the green light seconds, the yellow light will be ""fixed at 10 seconds"" before turning to a red light, so that vehicles have enough time to quickly pass through the intersection and clear the intersection. 2. At intersections with more than 2 lanes in the same direction, it is recommended to install red light camera poles to take pictures and issue fines to punish violators who intentionally violate the signal light instructions.']"

Now almost all middle schools and high schools have the so-called ""eighth after-school tutoring"", which is about from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. It is clearly stated in the law that ""the progress of the course shall not be taught in advance"", but in fact it is common for teachers to use the eighth class exam, teach the progress of the course, and catch up with the class. Even if the Ministry of Education and the education bureaus of various counties and cities learn of the violation, there are no relevant penalties in law to deal with it. The original intention of the planning of this after-school tutoring should be like the above-mentioned ""providing students with homework review, deepening and broadening the learning activities of the curriculum"", but it seems that it has not achieved this effect at present, and it was originally supposed to allow students to participate freely, but because they are afraid that they will not be able to keep up with the progress of the teacher and classmates if they do not register for the eighth class, they form a somewhat ""semi-forced"" free participation.

Even locomotives have relevant laws and regulations to force the design of full-time lighting (small lights), and there is a small light switch. But since there are already relevant laws and regulations that are concerned about safety, why don’t cars also add a full-time lighting design? There are daytime running lights in the front, but why is the rear light not mandatory for full-time lighting? The car design is getting better and better now! In the past, people saw that the dashboard was on when they were driving, which meant that the lights were turned on, but now the dashboard has become an electronic design that lights up as soon as the engine is started. At night, a lot of people don’t know that they are driving on the road without turning on the headlights. In the city, there are lights and they can still see the car.

However, with the progress of the times, the technology of led headlights is becoming more and more mature. Many car manufacturers use led headlights instead of ordinary halogen bulbs when new cars come out. There are also many benefits of using LEDs, such as power saving, brighter and so on. However, according to the current laws and regulations, there is no regulation or prohibition on LED lights, which leads to the confusion that some LED lights are legal and some LED lights are not. At the same time, when driving at night, in mountains, in fog, in alleys, in suburbs, etc., the headlights often cannot meet the demand due to the design of the automobile and motorcycle itself, and sometimes accidents are caused. Suggestions Make clear usage specifications for LEDs: 1. Formulate LED manufacturing specifications and inspection systems, such as commodity inspection. It is required that the manufacturer must submit it to the management unit for inspection before it is produced, and it can only be sold if it passes. 2. Formulate clear usage regulations to prevent chaos from causing bad traffic. For example, prohibiting the use of bird hunting lights, or making it impossible for other passers-by to drive vehicles normally. Restrict the use of only colors in accordance with current laws and regulations, for example, choose 3000k to 4300k white light or light yellow light similar to halogen bulbs. 3. Inspection system, for example, after refitting the car and turning on the headlights, it is necessary to go to the management unit for inspection to ensure that the vehicle's light type, brightness, and color are in compliance with the regulations. If it does not conform to the specifications, it is required to correct or restore it. If it passes the inspection, it should be indicated on the business license, so that reasonable modification can be legal. 4.

When there are no street lights and it is foggy at night, and there are bicycles without warning lights, and you have to ride a distance of 3 meters before you can detect someone or a solid object in front, how dangerous is it to a rider with poor lighting?

Therefore, gender equality education in schools plays a very important role in the construction of students\' gender equality concepts. Recently, some groups have demanded that parental consent be required to participate in the sex education part of gender equality education on the grounds of parental supervision, and that gay education should not be forced to participate. Article 2 of the Basic Education Law stipulates that students are the subjects of the right to education. One of the purposes of education is to promote respect for basic human rights among students, and parents have a duty to assist in the realization of this purpose. Therefore, this action is tantamount to infringing on students\' right to receive gender equality education, and hinders the construction of students\' gender equality concept. Sex education and gay education are of great significance in the construction of sexual values \u200b\u200band multiple gender concepts. Without sex education, the development of students\' sexual values \u200b\u200bwill be affected; without gay education, students will not be able to recognize and respect gays. Coupled with the fact that heterosexual hegemony in society has not yet disappeared, the risk of gays being discriminated against or bullied will be greatly increased. The Ministry of Education is requested to revise Article 13 of the Implementing Rules of the Gender Equality Education Law: ""The courses related to gender equality education stipulated in Item 2 of Article 17 of this law shall include emotional education, gay education, and sex education to enhance students\' gender equality awareness."" Change it to ""The courses related to gender equality education stipulated in Article 17 Paragraph 2 of this Law shall include courses such as emotional education, gay education, and sex education to enhance students\' gender equality awareness. Parents must not interfere or prevent students from participating in courses related to gender equality education."" To ensure that students\' rights can be protected.', 'The government is requested to strictly abide by the ""Gender Equality Education Law"", continue to implement gender equality education and gay education in accordance with the law, and ensure a diverse and friendly campus environmentRecently, on the government\'s public policy online participation platform, there have been many proposals to abolish gay education, or even abolish gender equality education. However, gender equality education, as an important policy of our country to protect human rights and constitutional equality, should not be abolished because of the claims of discriminators, nor should it be discounted because of the opposition of a few people. We require the Ministry of Education to abide by the ""Gender Equality Education Law"" and continue to actively promote gender equality education. The legislative purpose of the Gender Equality Education Law is to implement the provision of equal rights stipulated in Article 7 of the Chinese Constitution, to enrich the resources and environment for gender equality education, to enhance the nature and content of education, and to build a gender-equal civil society. It was enacted by the Legislative Yuan in 2004. The primary purpose of gender equality education is understanding and respect. Only by cultivating students’ gender awareness and multi-gender perspectives through education, building the ability to reflect on their own experiences, and increasing their sensitivity and insight into gender presuppositions and operating mechanisms in the school system, young students can be aware of their social position and position in daily life practice and face related issues, increase understanding, respect and care for different experiences and values, and truly implement a modern society of democracy, equality, and freedom. We are all opposed to gender prejudice and gender discrimination, let alone the case of Ye Yongjun, which shows that contemporary campuses are full of hostility towards male students with femininity, which not only seriously damages their right to study, but even endangers the more basic personal safety and right to life. The meaning of gender equality education is not only to understand gender, but also to create a gender-equal learning environment. We believe that schools should strive to create a friendly campus environment, so that students of all genders and gender orientations can freely and fully learn and develop themselves. Schools should face up to the diversity of sexual orientation, give equal treatment to different sexual orientations such as heterosexuality and homosexuality, and respect the choices of students and teaching staff. We firmly request the Tsai Ing-wen government and the Ministry of Education not to deviate from the concept and value of human rights, and to continue to affirm that volunteer education is an indispensable part of gender equality education. At the same time, the government should continue to promote diverse gender equality education in accordance with the ""Gender Equality Education Law"" and the ""Gender Equality Education Law Implementation Rules""!', 'Gender equality education committees at all levels should have LGBTQ+ people as membersAccording to Article 1 of the Gender Equality Education Law, the purpose of establishing the Gender Equality Education Committee (that is, the legislative purpose of the Gender Equality Education Law) is to promote the substantive equality of gender status, eliminate gender discrimination, maintain human dignity, and cultivate and establish gender equality educational resources and environment. In addition, the aforementioned ""promoting substantive equality of gender status"" includes multiple gender/gender attributes such as biological sex, sexual orientation, gender traits, and gender identity according to Article 2, Item 1 of the Gender Equality Education Law Enforcement Rules. Therefore, Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Gender Equality Education Law stipulate that the number of female committee members should not be less than half of all gender equality education committees at all levels. This is because women are disadvantaged in this gender-unequal society, and their personal experience as women can make them more able to speak out for their rights. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the number of female committee members and ensure that they have equal power to claim their rights in the gender equality committee. However, women are not the only ones who are disadvantaged in this gender unequal society. The disadvantaged situation of LGBTQ+ is also often ignored. School curricula do not even mention the sexuality and life culture of gender minorities. Students and school personnel of gender minorities are still bullied and harassed from time to time. Shouldn’t minorities be protected? Therefore, sexual/gender minorities should also have a certain number of people in the gender equality education committees at all levels, so as to reflect the legislative purpose of the gender equality education law.']"

However, because the previous examination methods did not focus on driving ethics, drivers only operate vehicles without having correct concepts. However, the low driving literacy has led to a long-term unequal relationship between motorcycles and cars, and even a hatred mentality. In order to eradicate the above reasons and other accidents caused by low driving literacy, it is proposed to implement a national driver's license re-examination. Driving ethics education for automobiles, locomotives, and professional drivers: Before taking the test for each vehicle, you should have received at least four weeks of moral education, 10 hours a week, a total of 40 hours of moral education. Since many accidents are caused by bad driving habits and low quality, emphasis should be placed on driving ethics education. Car driver's license re-examination implementation method: The mandatory road test for cars has been launched in May this year, so after the driver's license is obtained in May this year, only 40 hours of moral education are required to attend again, and no license fee is charged. If the driver's license was obtained before May of this year, the road test and 40 hours of moral education lectures must be re-implemented, and the license fee should be increased by more than five times. Vehicles older than five years shall be inspected for overall vehicle safety, and the original manufacturer shall appraise and deliver a report to qualify for the examination. Implementation method of re-examination of motorcycle driver's license: At present, the motorcycle license examination is still too simple, and the difficulty should be increased to that of large and heavy motorcycles. In a fixed venue, there are several different routes. Let the examinees choose by lottery, memorize the routes and take the test. Moral education is 40 hours compared to a car. The examination fee should be increased to more than 20 times the current one. For locomotives older than five years, the overall safety inspection of the locomotive shall be carried out, and the original manufacturer shall appraise and deliver a report to obtain the qualification for the examination. How to replace the license: Integrate the driver's license and ID card, that is, after the driver's license is obtained again, the new ID card will be combined with the driver's license, and the driving qualifications of various vehicles will be recorded on it. Buffer time: Motor vehicles should complete the re-examination and license renewal within five years, and professional drivers must re-obtain a driver's license within half a year after the validity period expires. Vehicles that have obtained a new driver's license should affix a sticker to the license plate, or replace the license plate with a new one (background color). Expiration of the buffer time: If there are people who do not intend to obtain a new driver's license, their driving qualifications should be revoked, and the movable property of the vehicle under their name should have their license plates revoked and they should not drive on the road. Others: 1. Drivers who have not obtained a new driver's license shall pay 5,000 to 10,000 insurance premiums per year for each driving qualification. 2. If the driver who causes the accident is not the owner of the vehicle that caused the accident, the owner of the vehicle that caused the accident shall be subject to joint and several penalties. 3. Those who do not have a driver's license but own a vehicle movable property shall not be listed on the vehicle. If it is used jointly by family members, friends, etc., it should be registered together. To get a license plate. Article 2 joint and several penalties still apply when causing an accident. 4.

After the first level written test, you can go on the road, but you must be accompanied by someone who has more than three years of driving experience. The second level is the road test. After passing the test, you can officially go on the road. The third level is to take another road test after two years. My wife took the driver's license test, and I realized that Taiwan's license test model and the teaching method of the driving training class are only for you to pass a test, not to ensure that students can drive safely without affecting other drivers, and have good driving habits that are not illegal. Seeing that the teacher will only teach you to kill the steering wheel of the first tree, and stick your head out to see when reversing, etc., I think it is really ridiculous. Crowded locomotives crashed their heads? Later, after my wife got her driver’s license, she still drove in a mess on the road. What’s the point of this way of getting a license? It’s all like this. In fact, all these things can be solved at the source. Please re-examine the current examination method to make it more in line with modern times and should be stricter.

Regardless of whether it is a laborer or a military public education, according to the current law, as long as the service has reached 15 years, you can choose whether to receive a monthly occupational pension.

After the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" ended, an earthquake warning message was broadcast on the side of the screen for a few minutes to remind the public to beware of aftershocks. When the scale of the earthquake and the affected area are relatively large, information cards such as earthquake notices can be broadcast after the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" to remind the public of correct disaster prevention knowledge. Standardize and unify the broadcasting conditions of ""Earthquake Quick Report"", including seismic intensity and whether it is a regional earthquake, etc. Unify the screen ratio and duration of the ""Earthquake Quick Report"" broadcast. Standardize the broadcasting conditions of earthquake information cards. Solution Through laws and regulations to regulate the media of each channel to add the broadcast function of ""Earthquake Quick Report"" cover station. TVB broadcasts ""Earthquake Quick Report"" by itself; cable TV channels are broadcasted by the cable TV operator (system) in a unified way. In addition, news channels have a lot of information displayed on the screen at the same time to prevent news information from being covered up, so they do not broadcast on news stations. Other possible ways are welcome to discuss. The above is a relatively unprofessional proposal. If there is any mistake, corrections and suggestions are welcome.Dynasty']"

Although in Taiwan, as long as you pay health insurance premiums, you can enjoy the same medical services, regardless of whether you are rich or poor, but we know that health insurance is wasted by some people through improper medical practices. However, because every insurer pays health insurance fees every month, he enjoys the protection of health insurance payment, regardless of whether his behavior of using health insurance is restrained or legitimate. Taiwan’s health insurance system should guarantee and provide adequate medical care for Taiwanese. It is a matter of enjoying Taiwan’s health insurance in a reasonable and legal manner, and Taiwan’s health insurance is already a matter of public interest. Therefore, it should be ruled out that those who slander and disrupt social order and unity against the health insurance provider country and report to China indiscriminately target those who are Taiwan independence. We strongly urge the former Legislative Yuan to redefine the exclusion of money from health insurance recipients for the behavior of people like Huang An, so as to achieve the principle of fairness, justice and justice for Taiwan’s health insurance users."", 'Complete and complete reform of health insurance solutions - a complete solution to the loss of health insuranceComplete and thorough reform of health insurance solutions to completely solve the loss of health insurance 1. Payment by use ratio: pay health insurance premiums according to the status and frequency of use of health insurance, regardless of age. 2. The controversy that the health insurance premiums for criminals held in detention centers should be borne by the whole people: all criminals held in detention centers and criminals in jail need to work in prison or use social work to pay for health insurance. 3. The National Health Insurance Administration uses fictitious income to charge people with no working income the same health insurance premiums, falsely claiming that all have unemployment subsidies and low-income household subsidies: compared with all people in Taiwan, people without working income and low-income households pay less health insurance premiums, but they also pay according to the proportion of use: regardless of age, health insurance premiums are paid according to the status and frequency of use of health insurance. 4. Health insurance rats: According to Taiwan media citing statistics from the National Health Insurance Administration, in 2015, 57,000 people returned to Taiwan for medical treatment and then withdrawn their insurance halfway. These people are also called health insurance rats by the media. Before the health insurance rats leave the stage, they must pay off the previously accumulated health insurance premiums, otherwise they will be punished and permanently denied health insurance. 5. Specialists in internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics have a high risk of medical disputes and a heavy burden, but the benefits of national health insurance obviously do not reflect the risks and burdens of these specialties, making it difficult for these four departments to recruit enough new blood and talents. 6. Drug price black hole: If a disease is treated and paid for at a price; or paid on a per-person basis, medical institutions will consider the final economic benefits, and medicines are included in a larger payment unit (either on the disease or on the person), and the drug price black hole is naturally meaningless. However, this system also has disadvantages. Because the difficulty of treatment for the same disease varies from person to person, many previous examples show that hospitals will be more willing to reject patients who are more difficult to treat (such as the elderly and those with complicated conditions, although this system will give these patients higher benefits), and hospitals will discharge patients early because the patient\'s benefits have been exhausted...etc. Unfavorable consequences for patients. Hospitals discharge patients early due to the exhaustion of the patient\'s benefits...and other unfavorable consequences for patients set relevant severe penalties. 7. Medical staff should avoid overtime work. However, some senior doctors still have the concept that ""long-term overwork is a necessary training to become a qualified doctor"", which is also a factor that causes young doctors to overwork. Mandatory legislation stipulates the length of working hours of medical staff, sets up a medical malpractice reporting website and sets up a reward and punishment system, and provides channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. Number of visits, performance issues: large hospitals will go all out to see a doctor regardless of the real needs of patients. The relevant penalties are stipulated in the legislation, and a medical malpractice reporting website is also set up and a reward and punishment system is set up to provide channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. 8. Doctor elimination system: For medical disputes, we also set up a medical malpractice reporting website and set up a reward and punishment system to provide channels for reporting medical staff and patients in Taiwan. Serious cases will be dismissed for life. 9. The cost of medical care is moderately increased, and payment is made according to the proportion of use, including self-pay and health insurance. 10. Hospital certification reward and punishment system, set up a Taiwan-wide hospital certification website, and formulate a reward and punishment system. For those who are unqualified and refuse to listen to repeated persuasion, the hospital will not be included in the scope of health insurance if the situation is serious, until it improves. 11. Hospitals across Taiwan have established a joint network of health insurance: record the integrity of medical records, avoid abuse of health insurance resources and improve medical quality.

I hope that all members of the Legislative Yuan and Minister of Health and Welfare Lin Zuoyan will adopt and implement it.', ""Let health insurance return to the form of insurance - insurance as the mainstay, supplemented by social welfareAt this stage, people working overseas with health insurance cannot verify their income, so they can use the minimum insurance amount (900 yuan) to guarantee the use of health insurance. It is easy to cause resource abuse, so that people who need health insurance cannot really get resources and accelerate the risk of health insurance bankruptcy. In addition, some people who misuse health insurance as an all-you-can-eat resource also need to adjust the amount of insurance and limit the use of it, just like the medical insurance launched by various financial institutions. The current health insurance grades are as follows https://www.nhi.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=74D1AF4F883FB56D&topn=5FE8C9FEAE863B46 The insured amount ranges from 900 to 6400 depending on income. The health insurance adjustment plan is as follows. 3 days (half a year). For those who have not lived for more than half a year, the insurance amount will be increased (the scope of the increase will be assessed by financial and insurance experts). Like most medical insurance or accident insurance, long-term living in dangerous places (areas with poor sanitation conditions, areas with frequent wars, etc.) has a higher risk of returning to use health insurance due to illness, so it is natural to need to adjust the premium (determining the cost for additional discussion-requires financial and insurance experts to assist in the assessment)- (if you live in the area because of charity or medical assistance, you can provide proof and use the minimum insurance amount) Health insurance (consulting and receiving medicine) (unless the doctor confirms different medical conditions or the medicine is ineffective or needs to be adjusted - according to the doctor's professional assessment - if it is found after the self-paid consultation that adjustments are needed or the situation is different, a supplementary application for health insurance can be made) 3-1: Supplement It is like a hospital or clinic repeatedly overturning the assessment, but prescribing similar medicines. The government needs to come forward to supervise whether there is any suspicion of fraudulently receiving health insurance. 4. People who have lived overseas for a long time and come back to use health insurance after suffering a serious illness.

Central government agencies should pay attention to the implementation of non-governmental organizations and individual supplementary (donation) budgets 2. The implementation rules of the Government Procurement Law require art, cultural, social welfare or other non-profit organizations to undertake government entrustment, commissioning, procurement or other forms of cooperation. Explanation: Many organizations will complain that when the government implements procurement or subsidy projects, it adopts an after-the-fact write-off system for disbursement of funds. Therefore, the executive agency must advance the payment. That would be a burden for smaller groups. However, since this must be the case in the procurement process, this is also difficult to say. However, in many cases, after the completion of the plan implementation and write-off, the relevant funds still need to go through a lengthy administrative process before they can be allocated to the relevant agencies. It may be as long as several months or even half a year. This will undoubtedly make the situation worse for the aforementioned groups. Because the advance payment has been very hard, but the money advanced is not known when it will be returned. This will cause serious cash flow pressure for small organizations or groups, and even make the organization or group unable to continue to survive. In fact, the government\'s preparation of relevant budgets is undoubtedly to encourage related services or industries. If this makes it difficult for groups to live, it may have violated the original intention of the policy. Moreover, according to Article 229 of the Civil Law, ""Where there is a definite time limit for payment, the debtor shall be liable for the delay from the expiration of the time limit."" Both the procurement case and the subsidy case have a definite time limit, and unless otherwise specified, both parties shall fulfill their respective obligations within the contract. Therefore, the delay in disbursement of subsidies or purchases shall be responsible for the delay. According to Article 231 of the Civil Code, if the debtor delays, ""the creditor may request compensation for the damage caused by the delay. The debtor in the preceding paragraph shall also be responsible for the damage caused by force majeure during the delay."" Therefore, the administrative agency should be legally responsible for the delay in appropriation. For the determination of the basis of compensation, there is the concept of legal fruits in the civil law, ""statutory fruits refer to interest, rent and other income obtained from legal relations."" Therefore, interest is used as the benchmark for measuring the liability for delayed payment. Therefore, it is advocated that when government agencies purchase or subsidize art, social welfare or other non-profit organizations, interest should be paid if the payables are not paid within the plan or contract period. bear the minimum liability for compensation. The calculation of the interest rate is based on the deposit interest rate in the postal savings account. The proposed articles are as follows: 1. The central government agencies should pay attention to the implementation of the supplementary (donation) budget of non-governmental organizations and individuals. Subparagraph 10 of Item 1 of Article 4 is added: (10) For the settlement of subsidy (donation) funds, if there is no violation of the contract and the recipient is an art, social welfare organization or other non-profit organization, the subsidy (donation) should be issued within one month. Violators shall pay interest. 2. After the completion of item 3 of Article 101 of the Implementation Rules of the Government Procurement Law, the agency shall pay the purchase price within one week. If the payment is delayed and the manufacturer is an art, social welfare or other non-profit organization, interest should be paid.', 'The Taiwan version of the Project Management Act, no longer wasting people\'s tax moneyThe White House of the United States was signed and promulgated by the President on December 14, 2016.

Therefore, I propose that Japanese and Vietnamese languages \u200b\u200bshould be added in public places so that resources can be provided to those who really need them, while Taiwanese and Hakka should be deleted, and traditional languages \u200b\u200b(including Hakka, Taiwanese and the traditional languages \u200b\u200bof various aboriginal peoples) should be included in formal education.', 'Return my native language (Taiwanese, Hakka, Aboriginal language), the government should actively protect Taiwan\'s native language!After the National Government moved to Taiwan, it implemented the Mandarin Movement and vigorously promoted Mandarin (Beijing dialect). People are required to use Chinese in public places, and schools are also prohibited from using their mother tongue, which has dealt a blow to Taiwan\'s original native languages \u200b\u200b(Taiwanese, Hakka, and aboriginal languages). Even if the national language campaign is no longer implemented after the lifting of martial law, the government starts to promote local languages, and primary schools have to teach mother tongue once a week, but it still cannot prevent the decline of Taiwan\'s native languages. Currently the most dominant and most popular Taiwanese language spoken by about 70% of the population, many of the younger generation can no longer converse fluently, and some even do not know it at all. If the Taiwanese language alone does not take root as soon as possible, some scholars predict that the Taiwanese language is very likely to disappear by the end of this century. Not to mention Hakka and Aboriginal languages? Language carries culture. If the native language disappears, Taiwan\'s native culture will face a huge loss. If the local culture disappears, it will be difficult for ordinary people to form a national identity for Taiwan. Therefore, the government should actively protect Taiwan\'s native language immediately. I suggest that the government take the following actions: 1. Promoting legislation to list Taiwanese, Hakka and all aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bas official languages \u200b\u200bso that the government has legal basis and is obliged to actively protect native languages. 2. When the heads of ministries and commissions at all levels of the government make public speeches, they should use their mother tongue as much as possible. 3. Encourage people to use their mother tongue in public. 4. Written official documents of major policies, in addition to Chinese, should also have versions in Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages \u200b\u200b(the use of Chinese characters or vernacular characters in written texts in Taiwanese and Hakka can be discussed further). 5. People have the right to use their mother tongue to communicate with government agencies, and the government should provide translators in a timely manner if necessary. (Refer to Fiji’s language policy) 6. All broadcasts on means of transportation (including airplanes, passenger transport, etc.) and public places (including department stores, hypermarkets, etc.) should have Taiwanese and Hakka versions, and they must be played in full, and the broadcast should not be interrupted due to lack of time. In places with a large population of indigenous peoples, there should also be broadcasts in indigenous languages. 7. In terms of education, the basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe national language curriculum outline of the Ministry of Education mentions ""the ability to correctly understand and flexibly use the native language"" at the beginning. However, among the native languages, the current school is completely dominated by Chinese, and there are almost no Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bthat are also native languages. In my opinion, the language education policy can refer to Hong Kong\'s current biliterate and trilingual policy. Currently, half of the Mandarin classes in schools at all levels can be taught in the mother tongue and half in the Chinese language, and other subjects should be taught in the mother tongue as much as possible. 8. The compulsory basic Chinese in universities should be replaced by the study or research of native culture and language, which will help ethnic groups blend and promote mutual understanding. All courses in the university can be taught in their native language according to the wishes of individual teachers. 9. The Ministry of Culture should immediately and completely stop subsidizing the filming of Chinese-language programs. 10. The Ministry of Culture should encourage TV stations to produce programs in Taiwanese, Hakka or aboriginal languages, and allocate subsidies to high-quality local language programs.', 'Amend the Language Equality Guarantee Law, add Vietnamese and Japanese in public places, and change traditional languages \u200b\u200binto the curriculum1. At present, there are many Vietnamese migrant workers and their spouses in Taiwan. Many of them cannot understand Chinese and English. We should put Vietnamese on the radio and marquees in public places to help them live in Taiwan and adapt to Taiwan as soon as possible. 2. At present, there are many Japanese tourists who come to Taiwan to travel, but they cannot understand Chinese and English. We should put Japanese on the radio and marquee in public places, so that it is possible to increase the number of Japanese tourists to come to Taiwan. 3. In Taiwan, Chinese is our official language. Although not all Taiwanese can read and understand Chinese, they can understand Chinese, so there is no need to play Taiwanese and Hakka. If we really want to improve the traditional language skills of today’s young people, using public broadcasting is not a good way. I think education is the only way to really improve the level of traditional language, so that the traditional language will not be lost, and only Taiwanese and Hakka are played in public places, which is not fair to the aborigines. Why can Taiwanese and Hakka be released, but not the languages \u200b\u200bof the aboriginal people? There are some Aboriginal languages \u200b\u200bthat are really dying out.

As a result, voters can only vote for ""bad candidates"". By ""disagreeing with the above candidates"": 1. Allow voters to express their disagreement with the candidates. 2. If the number of votes is lower than that of candidates who disagree, they will not be elected and will be banned from participating in any public office elections for 5 years, which is the cooling-off period for elections.

Is ""support poll"" one of the root causes of election bribery, underground gambling, malicious attacks, abandonment of insurance, and manipulation of candidates by funders? 4. Is it easy to be taken out of context and distorted by promoting policies and ideas when running for election? 5. ""Candidate\'s character"", during the election period, is it difficult to judge right from wrong, and it is mostly smeared? -------------------------------------- 4 methods 1. ""Adopt two-stage voting"" 2. ""Shorten the election time"" (from registration to voting) 3. ""Polls only focus on issues, not candidates"" 4. ""Each political party can propose multiple candidates, and then combine votes"" (also applicable to non-party membership) ---------------------------------------------- The details are as follows Method 1: Adopt two-stage voting The first stage: first decide whether the ""incumbent"" can continue in office? (Yes or No) (If not, one month later, Proceed to the second stage) The second stage: elect the ""next"" to prevent the ""current"" from being unable to lose and accuse the opponent of voting. Avoiding the hostile relationship between ""current"" and ""candidates"" is conducive to subsequent handovers and allows new appointments to get started quickly. Avoid the ""incumbent"" holding on to the ruling resources and ""candidates"" duel, resulting in unfair competition. Organizations or media can investigate the satisfaction of the ""incumbent"" in ""normal times"", so that the public can discuss the results of governance at any time. Compete with yourself, not with others. ""Incumbents"" can focus on their own governance and reduce the time, energy and money consumption of competing with others. -------------------------------------------- Method 2: Shorten the election time (from registration to voting) •In an age of illiteracy and lack of information, candidates have to give speeches everywhere, which requires a long election time. •In an era of less illiteracy and the age of smart phones, candidates\' political opinions can be seen and heard in a short period of time. •Those who intend to stand for election can ""normally"" publicize their views and ideas on public policy to the public instead of publicizing after registration. • For ""social issues"" that need to be understood by the public, we should find ways to let the public know about them in normal times. (Arguing after the election is easy to be distorted, and often only ""issues that are easy to be manipulated"" are left) --------------------------------------------- Method 3: Polls only target issues, not candidates The reasons are as follows • ""Candidates"" will ""attack"" candidates with ""highest or close"" poll results • ""Candidate support"" will become the basis for election bribery and underground gambling (which constituency, how far behind, and how many people will be bribed) Question: What does ""support poll"" mean? (In the previous era, elections cost a lot of money, and donors and candidates conducted polls in order to know their chances of winning) (In the future era, for the public interest, to achieve fair elections, can the law be amended to restrict support polls?) -------------------------------------------------- Method 4: Each political party (including non-party affiliation) can launch multiple candidates. The more candidates there are, the more one-on-one duels can be avoided and social polarization can be avoided. The more candidates there are, the less control the donors have on the candidates. Avoid internal fighting, which is a great loss to any organization. It can truly reflect the number of votes won by the candidates, avoid the abandonment effect, and avoid the watermelon clinging to the big side. --------------------------------------------- Specific implementation method A ""gamified electronic voting method"" (the following is an example) 1. Electronic registration (day 1~4) Anyone who is willing to participate in the election can register as a ""candidate"". Method 1: The platform assists in fundraising for 3 days, those who meet the standard pay the fee, those who fail to reach the standard refund, and complete the registration (3rd day). Method 2: The candidates pay the fee themselves and complete the registration (4th day) 2. Publish the ""list of candidates & political views"" and let the ""candidates"" debate their ""political views"" online or record them into a video. The public can upload ""all kinds of creative and funny stickers, and short videos"" through the ""real name system"" to support or oppose a candidate. (Real-name uploading is used to avoid malicious slander and rumors from some people) (People can choose whether to see multiple stickers and short videos when voting) (Day 5~6) 3. Electronic voting (Day 7) Use a ""facemash-like"" method to conduct one-to-one comparisons to attract people\'s full and in-depth participation. Next to the candidate\'s name, list the main political views. (Click more, you can watch short videos made by candidates for 3~5 minutes, or you don’t need to click.) (Click more, you can see various stickers and short videos, or you don’t need to click.) When the voting time is over, the system will announce the voting results immediately. (Billing) 4. The system automatically merges the ""number of votes of a certain political party candidate"" into the ""highest vote-getter of this political party"". The system automatically merges the ""number of votes for candidates without party affiliation"" into the ""highest vote-getter without party affiliation"". (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the combined votes are not combined to the highest voters, but are evenly distributed to the top 3 highest voters) 5. The system announces the ""highest vote winner"" as the elected candidate. (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the system will announce the ""top 3 high voters"" as the winners.)']"

If people disagree with such unreasonable judgments of such judges on Facebook, as long as more than (including) 10,000 people express their opposition to the judge\'s judgment on the case, in addition to asking the prosecutor who investigated the original case to help the victim or family members to appeal again, it is also suggested that the Ministry of Justice should set up a ""judge re-education training camp"".

It is mainly used to determine the facts. However, since the success or failure of the parties is crucial to the success of the litigation, if the mechanism for determining the facts is not properly operated, it is easy for the parties to cause surprise attacks and doubts about the judiciary and judges. Judges exercise their powers independently. At the same time, judges are required to transcend themselves, eliminate their subjective consciousness such as religious beliefs, political positions, ethics, moral concepts, and values, and stand purely on an objective standpoint ""independent of themselves"", and make judgments based on the constitution and laws based on the facts identified in the court. Therefore, judges in advanced countries with the rule of law put on wigs and black robes before appearing in court, and stand in front of the mirror to remind themselves: ""When I walk out of this door, I am no longer Xu XX, but a judge who assumes judicial independence and exercises power independently."" Appearing in court after self-vigilance is a judge in a country under the rule of law who can fulfill his mission. Therefore, the significance of independent exercise of powers by judges includes: on the one hand, to protect judges from external factors and the influence of the judiciary, to judge independently, and on the other hand, to strictly require judges to conduct trials independently beyond their ""self"". Therefore, the so-called trial principles such as free testimony and discretion for judges, which are almost self-centered on judges, completely violate the principle of judges independently exercising their powers. Judges independently exercise their powers to judge, which is definitely not to ensure that judges can conduct trials without restraint. The more core meaning is to conduct trials independently of themselves. The ""dinosaur judge"" that the public refers to is contained in the final judgment. The sentence ""judging the authenticity of facts based on free opinion is the application of the law"" is the judge\'s right to judge. Whether it is abused can not be controlled, and the parties can no longer appeal (because the reason for the appeal must be specifically accused of how the original judgment violated the law, otherwise it will be difficult to determine that it is legal). In view of this, Article 222 of the Civil Law should be abolished.', ""Require judges to stop adjudicating cases based on the judgments of the two conventions, and to bear legal responsibility for previous judgments, and to accept sanctions for improper judgments.This proposal is aimed at two items: 1.

The judges know the danger of the perpetrators and the possibility of recidivism, but they repeatedly let the perpetrators lightly, causing Taiwan to be like a criminal paradise, with rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and violent gunmen. ! ! At present, many murderers in Taiwan have escaped death because of mental problems. On the contrary, Shoko Asahara in Japan, even though he showed serious mental disorders in prison, was finally sentenced to death for criminal acts. Interpretation: 1. There are many controversies in the current legal judgments, among which the most controversial is that functional disorders or mental problems are used as the basis for lenient sentences. Due to the conditions of Taiwan law and the different judgments of the appraiser and the judge, many of the judgments were closed with lenient or lenient sentences, causing more pain and helplessness for the victims and their families, as well as dangers to people's lives and property. In the future, if the judge makes a judgment, the most serious crime committed by the mentally ill should not be exonerated by the death penalty in the two covenants. 2. In the judge's judgment, it is often mentioned that if the perpetrator has repented and did not investigate seriously, he has already had a lot of criminal records and still has no fear of recidivism, but regardless of its danger and harm to the people, a lighter sentence is given. Therefore, if the perpetrator who claims to commit the crime is arrested again in the future, the old case must be reviewed together to see if there is an issue of unfair or lenient sentence. Article 14 of the Judges' Act mentions: I swear to be sincere, accept the appointment of the state, strictly abide by the provisions of the Constitution and laws, uphold the spirit of detachment and independence, be fair and honest, be diligent and cautious, and perform the duties of a judge. If you violate the oath, you will be subject to the most severe sanctions. I swear. The regulations should clearly indicate the penalties and responsibilities that judges must accept when the trial is unfair or the result of the trial is seriously unbalanced. Put an end to dinosaur judges arbitrarily lenient sentences, or eliminate judges who are too weak or unable to bear this responsibility. (Many judges are unwilling to sentence death, in addition to supporting the abolition of death... in the end, it is because they are afraid that after death, they will become murderers, but what the people need is a public servant who can take all responsibilities and do things for everyone; instead of a judge who is sitting on a high salary but cannot fulfill everyone's expectations.) Judges should carefully consider the circumstances of criminals, give sentences that can be punished, and need to bear relative legal responsibilities to account for the victims and the people.""]"

Since there are only statutory anniversaries and festivals, the whole family should celebrate the holidays, and only laborers have holidays that violate the meaning of celebrating commemorations. Moreover, it is currently stipulated that elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university teachers have no vacation on Teacher\'s Day, and must still go to work on Labor Day. Because university teachers have more flexibility in class transfer, only kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, high school teachers and students and other civil servants go to work, and the rest of the parents who are on vacation are out of sync. Furthermore, because kindergarten teachers are on holiday on Labor Day, children attending kindergartens in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools have even more needs and troubles for childcare. And if the logic is that teachers should not have a holiday unless they are working for labor, then teachers should have a holiday on Teacher’s Day, and students should not have a holiday unless they are working as a laborer. Then labor and other occupations such as Children’s Day should not have a holiday. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that only labor holidays on Labor Day should be amended with other anniversaries such as Children\'s Day.', 'Cancel the flexible holidays and make-up shift days in the office calendar designated (scheduled) by the government every yearThe advantages of canceling the flexible holidays and supplementary shift days in the office calendar designated (scheduled) by the government every year: 1. It can reduce the traffic flow during the national holidays. 2. If you make up work on Saturdays, there will be problems such as rest first and then make up. The government has the final say. 3. If you go to work on Saturday, there will also be problems that cannot be in line with international standards, such as the stock market...etc. 4. For industries that work according to the office calendar of government administrative agencies, when a national holiday falls on Tuesday or Thursday, they usually have a flexible holiday on that Monday or Friday, and make up work on the Saturday of the previous week to form a continuous holiday. But what about Labor Day Tuesday or Thursday? It will be automatically skipped. Another example is the Dragon Boat Festival in 106 years this year, which falls on Tuesday, May 30, so a flexible holiday will be implemented on Monday, May 29, and it will be changed to Saturday, June 3 to make up work. Originally, the make-up class was supposed to be on the previous Saturday, May 20th, but because May 20th this year coincided with the National High School Examination, the day of make-up work was changed to Saturday, June 3rd. That is to say, after a holiday, make up shifts. Therefore, for this year’s Dragon Boat Festival holiday, Monday, May 29 was originally a normal working day, and Saturday, June 3 was a rest day. After the swap, Monday, May 29 will be a rest day, and Saturday, June 3 will be a normal working day. Now the question is, if an employee is scheduled to leave on May 31, will they still be released on May 29? And if an employee reports on June 1, does he still need to go to work on Saturday, June 3? In this regard, the Ministry of Labor explained today that if the company is in principle on shifts one to five, but only changes this week, even new employees still have to follow the company\'s shift schedule, so the workers still have to go to work that day. According to the Ministry of Labor, workers going to work that day are still within the normal working hours and within the 40-hour working hours a week, so employers do not need to pay overtime pay or compensatory leave. The Ministry of Labor gave an example, just like employees who arrived on January 2, they cannot claim that the leave on January 1 was not taken, and they have to make up the leave. However, the Ministry of Labor also reminded that both employers and employees should make a clear statement before taking the job to avoid unnecessary labor disputes. 1060525 Citing Apple Daily’s August 4, 2013 report: The economy is depressed and the people are fighting for the economy. What should we do if we encounter flexible continuous holidays and business operations may be interrupted? Some manufacturers disagree with the government\'s flexible holiday measures. ""According to the practice of the Human Resources and Administration Office of the Executive Yuan, as long as the holiday is flexible, it may increase the troubles and costs of manufacturers. This approach is only beneficial to public agencies."" ""Depleting Taiwan\'s Competitiveness"" An optoelectronics manufacturer located in the Science Park gave an example. Taiwan has 115 holidays this year. However, the Spring Festival, Qingming Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival fall on Thursdays. Therefore, it has to flexibly adjust the holidays, and then make up classes and make up classes. The Taiwan government has always emphasized the need to be in line with the world. The executive of the company pointed out that unless natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes forced people to take vacations, this model of flexible vacation adjustments for the so-called convenience of the people is probably only found in Taiwan in the world. Not everyone who takes vacations can go to play, and they have to find a make-up shift on a Saturday, so the benefits of going to work are not good. Employees have no intention of making up shifts. It is understood that in order to facilitate flexible holidays, the Mondays (from Saturday to next Tuesday) or Fridays (from Thursday to Sunday) that are originally required to work must be taken together. Many corporate employees still have to go to work in order to cope with foreign orders and production business, especially many double-income families. On the other hand, the stock and foreign exchange markets have to ""make up"" transactions on Saturdays in order to cooperate with the make-up shift. However, the world\'s major stock and foreign exchange markets are closed that day, and overseas customers of enterprises are also on vacation. Xie Qijia, chairman of the Science Park Association, suggested that most companies in the park must cooperate with foreign customers. Most manufacturers are not happy to see such superficial holidays that conform to public opinion and take holidays for the sake of holidays. They hope that the government will not cause too much trouble for enterprises under the consideration of fighting the economy. The government responded to the opinions and appeals of the industry. Deputy Chief of Personnel Zhang Nianzhong only said that the current practice of flexible holidays has been discussed with relevant ministries, discussed with major industrial and commercial groups, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation. It has become a practice in recent years. When it comes to national holidays, if it falls on Tuesday or Thursday, the holiday can be flexibly adjusted. (Not on Labor Day).', 'Teachers\' Day should give teachers a holidayTeachers play the role of nurturing the pillars of the country, and they are extremely hard on weekdays. However, the so-called Teacher\'s Day is proposed to allow teachers to have a holiday, and it is also an affirmation and respect for the hard work of these teachers. Teacher\'s Day is a festival to thank teachers for teaching in the past year. It is intended to affirm teachers\' contributions and efforts for education, but it should also give teachers some feedback, so that it is more in line with the purpose of Teacher\'s Day. References As September 28 draws closer, Taiwan\'s laborers have also begun to plan how to use this ""extra day off"". The absurd thing is that this year (2016) Teacher\'s Day, only laborers have a holiday, but teachers are not allowed to have a holiday! In the eyes of the teacher, it is actually quite unpleasant. Teacher Tang, who has been teaching in Hualien for 19 years, wondered: ""They are called \'national holidays\'. Why is it not applicable nationwide? Don\'t teachers and civil servants count as part of the country?"" Since the problem of one holiday per case has not been resolved, the decision to delete the 7-day ""national holiday"" has not yet been finalized; and the legal working hours of laborers have been revised down from 84 hours in the previous two weeks to 40 hours a week since January 1, 2016. The national holiday that was ""misappropriated"" for the two-day weekly holiday in the past has not been deleted; but the fixed two-day weekly holiday has already arrived, so there has been a strange phenomenon of ""workers have a holiday on Teacher\'s Day, but teachers do not have a holiday"". Teacher Tang Yuxin, who has been teaching in Hualien for 19 years, put forward his views on this ""strange phenomenon"". He believes that national holidays can no longer be named ""national"" holidays, because only laborers can leave them: ""Civil servants, don\'t they belong to the state? If this holiday is purely meaningful to laborers, then some festivals should not exist. For example, ""Jiang Gong\'s Birthday Anniversary."" Employees are handled according to different legal sources: [Teachers] Except for a very small number of teaching staff who are subject to the Labor Standards Act, teachers are handled in accordance with the ""Measures for the Implementation of Memorial Days and Holidays of the Ministry of the Interior"", and this implementation method recognizes that Teacher\'s Day ""only commemorates, not holidays."" [Civil servants] Civil servants are subject to the ""Implementation Measures for Public Officials on Two-Day Weekly Rest"". For civil servants, national holidays are not allowed. 【Labor part】 Labor is facing ""national holidays"" in accordance with Article 23 of the ""Labor Standards Law"" implementing rules. In fact, before this year, laborers did not have a real ""two days off every week"". In fact, it directly appropriated these national holidays to weekends to make workers ""look"" like two days off every week. However, starting from January 1, 2016, the weekly working hours of workers have been reduced to 40 hours (in the past it was 84 hours per week), equivalent to employees who work 8 hours a day, and get the real ""weekly two days off"" without having to use national holidays. Because of this, the Ministry of Labor originally wanted to delete 7 days of national holidays and change them to 12 days; but a lot of controversy arose later, and the Legislative Yuan did not review it. As a result, according to the ""Labor Standards Act"", the laborers got the real two days off on a weekly basis, and it was too late to delete the national holiday. (Of course, there is another case of a one-off controversy, which will not be mentioned here.) Faced with these situations, the first to ""feel the impact"" are of course ""teachers who cannot take a holiday on Teacher\'s Day."" In addition to thinking that if the ""national holiday"" cannot be a national holiday, it should be changed to a ""labor holiday"" and those holidays with political and historical meanings should be removed. Teacher Tang also said that teachers are not as happy as outsiders imagine. The outside world has always believed that teachers have a ""cooler life"" than ordinary workers because they have winter and summer vacations. In fact, after deducting the two-day weekly holidays and spring breaks that are already off, the real extra is 28 days (if there is a concurrent administrative position, the leave will be different). Teacher Tang: ""You can think of this as a teacher\'s special leave. I have been teaching for 19 years. In fact, my ""special leave"" is about the same as that of a general manager in an outside company."" It seems to be very good, right? At least better than the situation for many laborers. However, what Teacher Tang said next is a bit interesting. ""If the teacher is also in administrative positions, it is possible that he or she will need to take vacations on weekdays (not winter and summer vacations)! However, if the teacher is on vacation on weekdays, he must ""pay for the substitute teacher\'s fees and tutor fees by himself."" In other words, if a senior teacher is also in administrative duties, he will basically encounter the situation of ""spending money to buy vacations"". In addition to public holidays and maternity leave, the school will pay the ""hourly fee for the substitute teacher"". In other cases, whether it is your accumulated leave, personal leave, or sick leave, you must pay the hourly fee for the substitute teacher yourself. This is hardly known to those who are not teaching. Normal vacation, but still have to pay?']"

Proposal: Traffic lights for vehicles indicate straight ahead and right turn separately. When the green light for pedestrians is on, the straight green light for vehicles can be on, but the right turn light still shows red. After the red light for pedestrians is on, the green light for vehicles to turn right will be on to ensure road safety.', ""Add the signal lights of the exclusive time period when pedestrians at the four intersections of the cross road freely cross the road at the same time.1. According to the situation of the intersection, there are five lights, three lights and pedestrian lights. Pedestrians wait for different green lights at four intersections to cross the zebra crossing. As soon as the green light is on, vehicles can turn right and turn left to cross with pedestrians to form a dangerous crossing, and traffic accidents frequently occur here. Second, the speeds of pedestrians and vehicles are extremely disproportionate. Pedestrians are slow and fragile. Especially at the intersection with three signal lights, when the green light is on, the car turning right must preempt pedestrians, and the car turning left must go straight ahead one step ahead. It's like deliberately arranging to put pedestrians in danger of running a red light. 3. Recently, the Ministry of Communications proposed to move the zebra crossing inward, so that the car can turn left and right to extend the buffer distance. In fact, it is futile. How long is the buffer distance to be safe? In the end, there is still the phenomenon of people and vehicles crossing. And most of the cars want to be fast, if they can get ahead of pedestrians, they want to be the first, and they are impatient with the slowness of pedestrians. In addition, the zebra crossing is moved inward, which only increases the inconvenience for pedestrians. And the project cost is huge. Fourth, for this reason, it is proposed to add signal lights for the exclusive time period for pedestrians to cross the road. In particular, pedestrians at the four intersections of the open intersection freely cross the roads in different directions at the same time; there are straight travel, horizontal travel, and diagonal travel. That is, pedestrians and vehicles are completely separated from each other. The required number of passing seconds depends on the flow of vehicles and people in various places."", ""Pedestrians walking on crosswalks are often hit or killed by turning vehicles. In order to avoid repeated injuries, please set up all-round special signs for pedestrians!Hello everyone: Taiwan is a small town with heavy traffic, which is well known to everyone. For a long time, Taiwan's transportation policy has been based on the rapid passage of vehicles and the resolution of traffic congestion. At the same time, many cheap methods are designed to effectively relieve traffic congestion, but invisibly endanger the safety of other passers-by. The green light allows vehicles to turn left and right, so that pedestrians must bear a high degree of risk when crossing the road at a green light through a crosswalk (commonly known as a zebra crossing). As everyone knows, large vehicles such as large trucks and buses will have a dangerous situation of inner wheel differential when turning. Regardless of whether it is a large or small vehicle, there is an A-beam design on the structure of the vehicle. These structurally necessary designs are likely to be blinded visually when the vehicle is turning. And large cars, because of the special factors such as long body and high driving position, it is often impossible to immediately detect whether there are pedestrians in front of the car and on the left and right sides at close range when the car is turning. When pedestrians walk on the crosswalk when the traffic signal is green, if the traffic signal also allows vehicles to turn left and right, the turning vehicle and the pedestrians passing through the green light often appear to cross. Coupled with the above-mentioned factors such as the blind spot of the A-beam design of the vehicle itself, the inner wheel difference caused by the turning of large vehicles, and other factors, newspapers and media have repeatedly heard the unfortunate news that pedestrians are injured or even killed by turning vehicles on crosswalks. In order to prevent such unfortunate news from happening again and again, the government should set up traffic signals exclusively for pedestrians to pass through! Let the pedestrian traffic signal and the vehicle traffic light signal be separated. When the pedestrian traffic signal light is on, the cheap measure of completely prohibiting the green light to allow the vehicle to turn left and right is to ensure the safety of pedestrians when crossing the road. At the same time, in order to facilitate pedestrian traffic and reduce the time of crossing the intersection, pedestrians should be allowed to pass in all directions during the time allowed by the pedestrian signal light. Finally, in order to avoid confusion among passers-by and increase traffic accidents, and to ensure the consistency of pedestrian crossing safety across the country, the setting of special signs and lights for pedestrian crossing should be consistent across the country and fully implemented. Some people may say that the current government is implementing a policy of comity to pedestrians. However, this policy cannot guarantee the safety of pedestrians crossing the road. The reasons are as follows: 1. Because vehicles turning left and right share the green light seconds with pedestrians crossing the road. In addition, when the red light permits the vehicle to turn left and right, the vehicle turning left and right (east-west direction) still has the danger of colliding with pedestrians (north-south direction) walking on the crosswalk. 2. Under the policy of giving priority to pedestrians, waiting for a long time for turning vehicles is likely to cause traffic jams, which will instead cause traffic congestion at intersections. Drivers of automobiles and motorcycles do not want to bear the pressure of the vehicles behind them, and often make forced turns, putting pedestrians in danger of being hit instead. 3. Taiwan's population is gradually aging, and the number of elderly people is increasing. Considering that the elderly move slowly, it takes a long time to cross the road, and the driving of automobiles and motorcycles is often not durable. 4. The law-abiding spirit of car and motorcycle drivers to yield to pedestrians is still not complete. Based on the above, in order to ensure that everyone can cross the road safely and without pressure, we urge everyone to support the proposal to urge the government to set up special signs for pedestrians crossing the road. thank you all. I wish you peace.""]"

But the most successful case of mobile payment is in Kenya in Africa. Yes, it is a place where we often see famine and drought in the news. Kenya has a population of about 40 million and 30 million mobile phone users, while mobile wallet users account for as much as 77%, which is much higher than other advanced countries. Local people use their mobile phones to complete payment transfers by typing in their account passwords. Taiwan is not very, very backward in terms of mobile payment, but it does not have a relatively complete mobile payment. In Taiwan, Manduo has launched mobile payment, but each mobile payment has a specific bank. The use of stores, for example, the mobile payment of store a is used in conjunction with bank A. If you go to store b, you can only change to another mobile payment. The government should unify the mobile payment system, coordinate with relevant banks, and actively guide more stores to join the ranks of mobile payment. You can also use mobile payment to open and transfer accounts with friends, so you don’t need to spend a lot of time figuring out how much a person should pay, and expand the usage rate of mobile payment. Therefore, relevant government departments should actively develop and promote mobile payment services, creating a miracle of mobile payment in Taiwan', 'Unify various payment terminals, fully implement electronic invoices, chip ID cards, and combine with Taiwan lottery tickets to stimulate the normal domestic consumption cycle.Unify various payment terminals, fully implement electronic invoices, chip ID cards, and combine with Taiwan lottery tickets to stimulate the normal domestic consumption cycle. Proposals or Suggestions Reason 1: Although electronic bills have been issued for a long time, they cannot be fully implemented. The government must use the Internet and big data to combine assets and financial functions to improve the industry. At present, the financial industry has already used or is actively investing in research and development of various payment functions. All consumption information is accessed with big data. Consumers can already check the details and confirm the correctness of consumption on the Internet, but there is no unified method for payment companies and financial companies. Suggestion: Let the financial industry provide virtual accounts for those who will use the payment function, and consider promoting accounts without savings books. (You can refer to the bank account opening method in Australia, and have three virtual accounts including flexible transfer account, short-term savings, and long-term savings.) And add online accounts according to your own financial planning. Virtually combine various payment functions, such as MRT, consumption, payment, etc., and bind it to a virtual flexible account in a personal bank. This virtual flexible account can transfer funds to different internal and external banks. If there is no amount in the virtual account, the transaction will fail. Online transfers can be made to this virtual account to use the payment function. Reason 2: The utilization rate of uniform invoices is low. Except for relevant large and medium-sized enterprises, most small and medium-sized self-employed businesses do not use invoices, such as beverages, catering, leisure and recreational equipment (fitness) and so on. Most people may directly throw them away at will, causing a mess in the environment, and they cannot recycle paper. The low winning rate cannot stimulate the domestic demand economy, but they are willing to spend money to buy the lottery. Suggestion: cancel all physical invoices, completely paperless, and return to the household. Consumers who do not have an account or are young self-contained consumers must issue consumption vouchers and redeem prizes by their legal representative. In addition to the basic tax, a certain amount of fee tax (paper tax, etc.) must be deducted. Those who return to the household shall be deducted according to the tax rate. Merge the Taiwan lottery ticket and the unified invoice, and all the non-winning amount of the Taiwan lottery in each period will be accumulated in proportion to the next unified invoice for redemption. And re-draft the uniform invoice award. For example: increase the number of special prize number groups from 1 group to 10 groups and change the amount to 1 million, increase the number of first prize number groups from 3 groups to 10 groups, and expect other awards to match the number of first prize numbers according to the original plan. However, if you receive a physical invoice, the award will be halved.', ""The government should lead the replacement and subsidy of the transportation network system and the merchant's electronic payment sensor equipment, so as to increase the utilization rate of mobile paymentAs a country, Taiwan is actually a small country in the world, but the speed of scientific and technological progress often lags behind other countries. In recent years, countries around the world have promoted mobile payment at a rapid pace. However, although the number of places using mobile payment in Taiwan has gradually increased, there is still room for growth. Therefore, I hope that the government should lead the establishment of mobile payment platforms, so as to increase the integration of electronic payments, electronic tickets, and mobile payment platforms, and then gradually increase the use of mobile payments in the country. Transportation is a problem that everyone will encounter when going out. As a person who used to live in Taipei, I think that if we can open the door of current transportation to mobile payment, it may be a good start to improve the use of mobile payment in our country, and there are not a few countries that use mobile payment and credit cards to enter the transportation network system. In fact, only the Taiwan High Speed \u200b\u200bRail can use credit card, mobile payment, and electronic ticket multiple entry gates. I think that if the Taipei MRT, Kaohsiung MRT, regional buses, and government platforms can all be equipped with multi-card connection devices, it may be possible to increase the use of mobile payment in the country. Moreover, increasing the establishment of mobile payment, credit card or multiple electronic tickets is beneficial to the flow of the social and economic structure, and it will help foreign tourists use credit cards as the main medium of transaction in tourism. If the government is willing to take the lead, and with the assistance of the county and city governments, improving the way people pay is also one of the responsibilities of the government. Therefore, I encourage the government to take the lead in updating the sensor equipment of the transportation network system and change it to multi-card (credit card, mobile payment, QR code scanning and electronic tickets). People's lives are more convenient. After all, in the age of wisdom, it is much more convenient for everyone to carry a mobile phone and carry various cards. This will also increase the convenience of foreign tourists visiting or sightseeing in Taiwan, and help improve the image of our country.""]"

It is suggested that the flag anthem of the Republic of China can be changed to the national anthem.', 'Amend the National Emblem and National Flag Law of the Republic of China, change the national flag and national anthem.The former president\'s Facebook post ""Xinyongge Story"" 2018/06/21PO stated that after the president pursued the ""inappropriate party property"" of the Kuomintang, he should make revising the ""National Anthem"" a top priority. The former president emphasized that the national anthem can be changed, and it has been changed several times in the past. Although the national flag has also been changed, it is a big deal. There is no need to amend the constitution or legal obstacles to change the national anthem, as long as the whole people have a consensus. Sources of administrative law: National flag: According to Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the National Emblem and National Flag Law of the Republic of China, the style of the national flag is specified in detail, because Article 6 of the Constitution of the Republic of China only restricts that ""the national flag of the Republic of China is designated as a red field, with a blue sky and white sun in the upper left corner."" Therefore, as long as it conforms to the description in Article 6 of the Constitution, modifying the National Emblem and National Flag Law of the Republic of China with the ""Ministry of the Interior"" as the competent authority to change the national flag does not exceed the authority of administrative units or doubts about unconstitutionality. National anthem: Because the constitution does not stipulate the national anthem, only the ""Republic of China National Flag and National Emblem Law"" where the competent authority is the ""Ministry of the Interior"" mentions the national anthem. The reason for the joint signature: ""After the 623 anti-red media parade, many people were displeased with the national flag containing the KMT party emblem and the lyrics of the national anthem. After inquiry by the proposer, it was found that the Republic of China had changed its national flag on December 29, 1928. It is hoped that the second change of the national flag and the first change of the national anthem of the Republic of China will be initiated.""

The second referendum was held from March 3 to March 24, 2016 to decide whether to change the national flag."" Suggestions: Flag: In order to comply with Article 6 of the Constitution, the style of the new national flag was changed to: ""Remove the KMT party emblem"" and use a white circular geometric figure to represent ""blue sky"".

The year is approaching, and there have been several recent drunk driving incidents that have caused many innocent families to face the tragedy of family destruction. However, drunk driving recidivists do not know how to repent. or convenience store purchases. (2) It is strictly forbidden for the public to drink alcohol in all restaurants in Taiwan. Anyone who violates the law will be fined heavily and sentenced for the crime of intentional homicide. (3) It is proposed to ask the Legislative Yuan to formulate a special law on drunk driving, restricting the people of Taiwan to only drink in their residences. Anyone caught drinking or drinking outside their residences will be fined heavily and sentenced for intentional homicide. (4) It is proposed to ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the law and formulate a special law on drunk driving of a criminal nature, imposing severe penalties and fines on active drunk driving offenders. (5) In addition, the Ministry of Justice announced that ""whether repeated drunk driving should be sent to prison for correction"", this correction measure may not be effective, because most of the drunk drivers are alcohol addicts, even after being sent to prison for correction, once they leave the prison, once they come into contact with restaurants and stores that sell alcohol, they are very likely to drive dangerously again after drunkenness, which will lead to death of drunk driving again. (6) Repeated drunk driving offenders should be regarded as serial offenders, with one punishment for each crime, and the death penalty or life imprisonment for serious drunk driving recidivists, in order to protect people\'s lives and legal interests! News URL: https://goo.gl/xuQyRt', ""Practical improvement measures to reduce the crime rate of drunk driving, together to improve road safety in Taiwan(1) Proposal motives: 1. Recently, a man surnamed Fang killed reporter Huang Weihan's mother while drinking and driving, and had drunk driving again 24 hours ago when his driver's license was suspended. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office admitted frankly that because of his first offense, he confessed to committing a crime without causing any accident, and he was not granted bail in the past, and he was not expected to commit another offense at that time. 2. The alcohol lock system was put on the road in March last year. After re-examination of the license for drunk driving recidivists, they must drive a car with an alcohol lock within one year before they can go on the road. However, due to the alcohol lock regulation, the car does not care about the person. If the drunk driving recidivist drives a self-driving car that is not equipped with an alcohol lock, the effect of preventing drunk driving will be greatly reduced. Since it was on the road for a year, 911 people have been recorded as only driving vehicles equipped with alcohol locks, but only 35 have been installed, and 876 people have not installed them, and the results are not good. (2) The purpose of the proposal: By comparing the crime rate of drunk driving in Japan with neighboring countries, we try to explore why Japan can reduce the number of drunk driving crimes to a very low level, and find out the laws and management methods that Taiwan can improve. (3) Actual suggestions and improvement methods: 1. A company specialized in driving under the influence of alcohol. Because of the cost of agency driving, people would rather take the risk of drinking and driving than pay more than 1.5 times the price of a taxi. Although there are currently many mobile phone apps that can provide taxi services and offer relative discounts on a regular basis, the service targets are not suitable for all people, only for the younger generation, and they are not attractive enough. Therefore, we hope that there will be a company that specializes in drunken driving, and the government will encourage its operation in a public-private manner. 2. Regardless of whether a new license is required to install an alcohol lock, the car owned by the drunk driver after three repeated drunk driving offenses must still be installed with an alcohol lock. After one year of DUI transfer and storage of the vehicle, the DUI driver should drive the car. If he asks others to blow the DUI lock or borrows a car from a friend, he shall be jointly and severally liable as the DUI escort. 3. Solve at the source. First-time drunk driving offenders have drunk driving precedents on their ID cards or related documents that prove their identity, and they are prohibited from buying alcohol within a certain period of time. If the relevant friends are found to provide alcoholic drinks, they will be fined. If you refuse to listen to the persuasion repeatedly, you will be provided with twice the penalty once more. Anyone who knows everything is innocent, so even if you don't know that the relevant friend has his label, you must be held accountable. 4. Change media attitudes towards drunk driving. Daily news reports include one or two reports on drunk driving. However, excessive reporting makes the public insensitive to drunk driving. The public only feels horror at the moment of the report, but they have no awareness of the crisis of drunk driving and no intention to reduce drunk driving cases. Only when drunk driving really happened to me will I discover the dangers of drunk driving and how little influence the report has on drunk driving."", 'Put an end to the recidivism rate of drunk driving, please support the real-name system for drinking!!The reason why drunk driving is difficult to eradicate is that drinkers, under the influence of alcohol, cannot clearly recognize that they are drinking or drunk, and then choose to drive with a fluke mentality or a heroism that challenges authority. Although heavy or light penalties have little effect on drunk driving, and the recidivism rate is high. I propose a real-name system for drinking: we should prohibit drunk drivers from drinking again. Insert the health insurance card into the system established by the government to check whether the customer has a drunk driving record. If so, the sale of alcoholic products to the customer is strictly prohibited. Violators will be fined heavily for the store and the drunk driver. Even as long as one of the guests at the same table has a drunk driving record, the store cannot sell alcoholic products to all the guests at the table. This will make it more difficult for the drunk driver to drink, thereby reducing the recidivism rate of drunk driving. The reduction in the recidivism rate of drunk driving in Taiwan alone can stop many drunk driving problems... and the rules stipulated by the law can be roughly like this: Drunk driving without causing an accident, the health insurance card will lock the alcohol for three years, the drunk driving driver, the health insurance card will lock the alcohol for five years, the drunk driving accident will cause death, the health insurance card will lock the alcohol for 15 years, and the person who sells alcoholic products to the drunk driving record will be fined five million, and all heavy fines will be included in the compensation fund of the victim’s family of the drunk driving accident. However, the original penalty for drunk driving must still be maintained.']"

In Taiwan until now, we still see news of disputes over the Boai constellation from time to time. The points that should be abolished and those that should be retained are sorted out below. Points to be abolished: 1. Moral kidnapping, giving up a seat has changed from a virtue to an obligation. 2. As long as your appearance does not conform to the image of ""old, weak, women and children"", you will be criticized for sitting on the fraternity seat. Although the promotional slogan has been changed to ""Please give up your seat to passengers in need"", it is believed that the government\'s publicity is not good enough, and many people who are sick on the surface are still blamed for this. 3. It is a waste of space. Many people would rather stand than take a fraternity seat. Most people don\'t take the fraternity seat in order to avoid controversy, resulting in a waste of space. Reservations: 1. Can ensure that vulnerable groups have seats. If the fraternity seat is abolished, not everyone has the consciousness of giving up their seat. In this way, it is actually very dangerous for people who need it but have no seat in a moving vehicle. 2. Not everyone has the virtue of giving up their seats, and we can continue to educate the public. As long as the fraternity seat is set up there, no matter you are sitting or just looking at it, you will have the consciousness to give up your seat. The above refers to Zhiqi Qiqi\'s video, and the URL has been attached below. *So what I want to propose is: it can be divided into disabled people, people who can’t see discomfort on the surface, pregnant women, the elderly, etc., and change the original fraternity seat to: set up an exclusive fraternity seat for each project (the fraternity seat for different projects is distinguished by color, and the blind can touch them with special materials to let them know that this is a special fraternity seat for blind people)', 'On various public transport vehicles, at least one additional compartment is set up as a priority seat (fraternity seat).In the past 70 years of the Republic of China, there were many accidents of falls and injuries of the elderly, and the Po Oi seat (priority seat) was added. Nowadays, there are a lot of controversies and news about Boai Seats (Priority Seats), etc. Most of these disputes are based on the judgment of some passengers. In the past, government agencies have responded to the issue of the retention and abolition of fraternity seats (priority seats), and they still need to retain a certain percentage (not less than 15%). But in fact, retaining a certain proportion of fraternity seats (priority seats) is still far from enough to provide seats to those in need. Therefore, I hope that everyone can support the proposal of ""adding at least one car as a priority seat (fraternity seat) on various public transport vehicles"", and to maximize the benefits of the seats. At the same time, promote the correct concept of fraternity seats (priority seats). 1. In public transportation vehicles, at least one additional carriage is provided with fraternity seats (priority seats). 2. Propagate the correct concept of priority seats (fraternity seats), and popularize (de-label) fraternity seats (priority seats).', 'Repeal the establishment of fraternity seats on various public transport vehiclesIn recent years, the cultural level of ordinary people in Taiwan has improved significantly, and it has become a common behavior to give up seats on public transportation to those in need. It\'s not limited to fraternity seats, but it\'s also common to give up seats in general seats. In recent days, disputes caused by fraternity seats have been heard from time to time. Most of these disputes are due to some passengers\' own judgment that certain people should not sit in fraternity seats. Age is not the basis for judging whether a seat is ""needed"", nor should it be the criterion for self-judgment whether I should give up my seat or not. Therefore, I suggest that we can continue to publicize the virtue of giving up seats through carriage advertisements or other media, but cancel the setting of fraternity seats. In my opinion, the fraternity seat does not require certain people to be able to sit, nor is there any law that mandates that seats must be given up. It is just a promotional practice. At present, most Chinese people have this habit, but the fraternity seat has brought negative effects: some people dare not sit in the fraternity seat, and some people think that the fraternity seat should be given up. Giving up our seat is a virtue, and if we are in good shape, we should naturally help those in need. But the person whose seat was given up should also understand and be grateful, instead of taking it for granted. The abolition of the fraternity seat will not make the virtue of giving up seats disappear from Taiwan, but it will prevent many disputes from happening. Therefore, I hope that everyone will support this proposal ""abolishing the setting of fraternity seats on various public transportation vehicles"".']"

Instead, spend a lot of the long-term care budget on preventive care for those who are not disabled! This policy has flagrantly violated the constitutional long-term care service. The principle of fair treatment of citizens, that is, everyone is disabled, and the government’s policy should subsidize all disabled people without bias! Therefore, we believe that the government should immediately correct the unconstitutional long-term care 2.0 serious unfair mistakes, and immediately correct the disabled who did not subsidize the selection of institutions! And formulate an equal subsidy policy that treats all disabled people fairly! Disabled persons choose their own suitable services!"", 'Building a village for the elderly with dementiaIn view of the serious aging population in Taiwan and the increasing proportion of dementia population, it is recommended that the government follow the example of the Netherlands, France and other countries to set up villages for the elderly with dementia to take care of the dementia population. According to statistics from the Alzheimer\'s Association, about one-third of the elderly have dementia, and the World Health Organization has even listed dementia as one of the five key diseases in the 21st century. As the age increases, the proportion of dementia is getting higher and higher. Taiwan, which has entered the aging society, has also been troubled by this problem for a long time. The elderly with dementia need round-the-clock care, and the person in charge of the care is usually a family member, which causes a huge burden on the family, and it is difficult for the caregivers to stay by the elderly\'s side all the time, so they can only prevent the elderly from danger by restricting their freedom. When the elderly with dementia are left alone at home, it is difficult to be found in time if danger occurs. Moreover, if the elderly continue to live in this abnormal way, they are prone to loneliness and even worsen their condition. At the same time, the family must always be in fear, losing their original life. How to enable the elderly with dementia to walk the last part of the journey with dignity without making their family members too worried and afraid has always been a problem that Taiwan needs to face. The current long-term care system is divided into dementia and disability. The government has made improvements in the care of the disabled, but the care of the dementia still needs to be strengthened. Dementia policies seem to be perfect, but in fact the implementation rate is generally low. The first reason: the lack of professional manpower, coupled with the ability of demented elderly to control their bodies, is a big problem for caregivers. The second reason: In the past, the long-term care system was priced by ""hours"", that is, within a certain period of time, the service staff will take care of the needs of the elderly, and there is no limit to any work. However, the current system adopts ""item-based pricing"". Resident service staff will leave after completing designated items, and no longer charge by the hour. As a result, long-term care loses flexibility, and the temporary needs of demented elderly are easily ignored. Moreover, the current long-term care projects are carefully classified and the prices are clear, which may cause the residents to lose their warmth in the process of caring for higher income. Based on the above description, setting up villages for the elderly with dementia in imitation of foreign countries can solve the above problems.']"

Primary schools employ a large number of part-time teachers, but they receive less than half of the salary of regular teachers for the same teaching hours. How to improve the quality of educationThe government sets a high threshold for full-time teachers (you miss the university course, you can only take the graduate school to take education credits), so that college graduates who do not have a teacher certificate but are passionate about teaching cannot obtain the teacher qualifications, and then hire these people with low salaries to become education wage earners. The weekly teaching hours are the same as full-time teachers. On the other hand, full-time teachers are guaranteed by the government. As long as there are no major mistakes, full-time teachers can retire comfortably and receive high pensions. In addition to tax increases and class reductions for teachers in recent years, elementary school teachers only have 2 to 3 classes a day on average. The work attitude of substitute or part-time teachers is often better and more positive than that of full-time teachers. The difference is that one is guaranteed and the other is guaranteed. How can such an educational quality be good? How can the country have hope in the future? I hope that the government will make the education system more open, so that more outstanding talents can enter the education field, and unqualified teachers will be eliminated naturally. More importantly, teachers should be paid equally for equal work, and teachers should not have class differences, which will cause injustice in education.', 'Acting teachers should be given a full 12-month employment periodAt present, part-time, acting, and substitute teachers account for a certain proportion of primary and secondary schools. Among them, acting teachers and regular teachers belong to the same staff establishment, and their work content and obligations are not significantly different from those of regular teachers. Many schools also allow acting teachers to concurrently serve as tutors, administrators, and co-administrators. However, there is a clear phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work between agency teachers and regular teachers, even among agency teachers. As acting teachers, some of them have the same employment period as regular teachers (the number is small), but most of them have an employment period of only 10 or 11 months (especially in county and municipal schools). In other words, most of the acting teachers were forced to lose their jobs during the two months of summer vacation, and there were contradictions in their identification during these two months. For example, when they wanted to apply for unemployment benefits, they were given various reasons such as ""fake unemployment"" or ""will have a job in two months"" (even if they have not yet confirmed that they will have a new job). , Even if they are not in administrative positions, some acting teachers (especially those who are re-employed) need to come to the school for support. However, the summer vacation is not within the employment period, which means that these acting teachers need to ""work without pay"" during the summer vacation. This also leads to the problem of occupational insurance. When the school requires these acting teachers to work in the summer vacation, they enter the labor insurance window because they are not in the employment period. Finally, the summer vacation of acting teachers is not included in the employment period, which also leads to the disappearance of the due leave. Each profession has its own leave. For example, although laborers have to work in summer, they have special vacations; formal teachers who are part-time administrative posts are similar to laborers. Only the acting teachers under the modified term of employment not only have no special vacation, but also have unpaid summer vacation; their rights and interests have been seriously damaged invisibly. Based on the above, the modified employment period of acting teachers (less than 12 months) has caused many problems, including: 1. Different pay for the same work as regular teachers.', 'The number of teaching hours for teachers in private schools should be clearly defined by law, and it should be in accordance with the Teachers Law regardless of whether public or private teachers are applicable, and should be in line with the spirit of the Regulations on Teachers\' Remuneration.According to the current ""Standards for the Number of Teaching Sessions per Week for Senior High School Teachers"", teachers in public schools have a basic hour of 14-16 sessions per week; private schools are not regulated, and teachers in private schools have a basic hour of up to 26 sessions per week. After the ""Regulations on Remuneration of Teachers"" was passed in 2014, the salary of teachers in private schools should be compared with that in public schools. But in fact, even if teachers’ salaries are compared, the actual remuneration of teachers in private schools is far from that in public schools. In the past, the ""Precautions for the Number of Weekly Classes for Teachers in Senior High Schools"" clearly regulated the number of weekly classes for teachers in public schools and private schools, in order to avoid the above-mentioned situation. However, the current ""Standards for the Number of Weekly Teaching Sessions for Teachers in Senior High Schools"" does not regulate the basic number of sessions in private schools. In the case of completely relying on the ""conscience"" decision of the school, ""cost"" is often a consideration for running a private school. Therefore, even if the law stipulates that the salary of private school teachers should be comparable to that of public schools, it is not uncommon for private schools to arbitrarily increase the basic number of teaching sessions for teachers, reduce the number of teachers hired, and then reduce costs. If the number of teaching sessions of teachers is too high, it will directly lead to the decline of teachers\' teaching quality in the classroom and affect the quality of students\' teaching. Regardless of public schools or private schools, the rights and interests of students should be the first consideration. The educational rights that every student should enjoy should not be sacrificed for the sake of ""cost"". To sum up, we believe that teachers in both public and private schools are dedicated to education at their posts, and operating costs should not be arbitrarily transferred to private school teachers; students in both public and private schools have the right to reject the business model of overworked teachers. Therefore, for a high-quality educational environment, please let private school teachers handle the same number of lessons per week as public schools. Concretely claiming to amend Article 32 of the ""Senior High School Education Act"" The standards for the number of teaching sessions per week for full-time teachers, joint teachers, professional and technical teachers, part-time tutors or administrative staff in public senior high schools shall be determined by the respective competent authorities. Revised Proposal Text The standards for the number of teaching sessions per week for full-time teachers, joint teachers, professional and technical teachers, and part-time tutors or administrative staff in senior high schools shall be determined by the respective competent authorities.']"

Lin Liangtai, chairman of the Transportation Society of the Republic of China, put forward seven suggestions. In addition to expanding the high-occupancy road sections and time slots, he also suggested that during the holiday period, not only the 20-kilometer mileage discount should be canceled, but also the fare should be increased. In fact, fare increases still cannot solve traffic jams and public grievances, and we still have to go back to the fundamentals. Just think about the expensive high-speed rail tickets we buy.

Emphasize that this proposal is to discuss whether teachers should wear uniforms on campus. The regulations (principles for senior high schools to formulate student clothing and grooming regulations) clearly state: In order to protect students' right to personality development and body autonomy, and to teach and encourage students to learn to manage themselves...therefore, relevant clothing regulations have been formulated, but students still have to wear school clothes (uniforms, sports uniforms, sports uniforms, etc.) 2. It is convenient to identify students' identities and prevent irrelevant people from entering the campus. However, school security incidents are emerging one after another, and uniforms can also be bought in stores outside, which does not play any role in safety and identification. Therefore, I think that if the above-mentioned goals are to be achieved, teachers can wear uniforms on campus like students, which can achieve better results. First of all, ordinary people can clearly distinguish the difference between students and adults, but they can’t tell the identity of the adults. There are hundreds of teachers in a school, and the teachers can’t recognize the teachers, let alone the students who have only been there for three years? Identify teachers.

I hope the Ministry of Education will explicitly prohibit schools from forcing students to wear uniforms. Everyone has the freedom to dress. Just like the country should not force citizens to wear national uniforms in order to cover up the gap between rich and poor, schools should not force students to wear school uniforms. Most school uniforms are loose and unattractive, and they are not warm in winter and not breathable in summer. Everyone has their own preferences in the material of clothes. We should not force everyone to wear the same clothes. Forcing students to wear uniforms is a violation of the freedom of students to dress, which is not in line with the constitutional protection.

In order to conform to the constitutional educational mandate and educational goals of freedom, democracy and the rule of law in a modern pluralistic society, schools should be improved to be free, pluralistic, open, neutral and tolerant. Therefore, there is no constitutional justification for requiring students to wear uniforms based on administrative convenience.

In addition, the excess loss insurance can compensate additional high compensation.

A few days ago, according to an official blue post of Blizzard Entertainment in South Korea, 13 players who were arrested at the beginning of the year for making coins in the game ""Overwatch"" have been tried, and two of them have been sentenced and will face a two-year probation. The other 11 suspects face a fine of about NT$300,000. For a competitive game, the use of cheating programs in the game is something that many players hate. However, from 2016 to 2017, ""Overwatch"" encountered a serious problem of cheating in South Korea. At that time, some Internet cafes in South Korea would provide free ""Overwatch"" accounts for Internet cafe guests to experience the game, and many people would keep using these accounts to cheat and play games, even if they were blocked, they didn\'t care. Although Blizzard has made changes to the relevant rules, it still cannot prevent the proliferation of cheating developers. Therefore, the South Korean government revised the relevant laws and began to implement them in June. If you violate the relevant laws, you may face up to 5 years in prison and a maximum fine of about 50,000 US dollars. You can refer to Korean law when making legislation. The topic mentioned that as long as it does not affect other people’s game experience, damage the fairness of game competition, use cheats to earn illegal profits and game currency, stream games such as minecraft load unofficial modules, and you will not be punished.

The following is a summary of the following points: 1. Many office workers simply do not meet the so-called ""insurance standards"" of the Ministry of Labor, which makes them unable to receive bailout subsidies. Many people have lost their jobs or stayed without pay due to the epidemic. Just meeting the minimum living needs may cause serious problems, not to mention the rent costs of renters. As a result, many people cannot survive. 2. The government has recently issued a relief fund of 10,000 yuan to children below elementary school. Considering that children have a lot of extra expenses, it is reasonable and necessary to provide subsidies. But what about minors who are not yet able to work, they still need the care of their parents, and all of these need money. Under the influence of the epidemic, the work of parents has been affected. Wouldn’t the upbringing of these minor children be affected jointly? 3. The government does not subsidize the elderly over the age of 65. 65 is probably the retirement age. Most of the elderly are no longer working to make money, and may live on their own pensions. But what about the elderly who rely on their children to support them? What about those who need nursing care or medical treatment for special diseases?

The original intention is to link up the kindergarten classes. However, kindergartens in many areas (for example, the four near my home) do not have kindergarten classes, or they have opened them before, and they have gradually stopped enrolling. (Because the kindergarten class can only accept 16 people, but the small class can accept 30 people. The teacher-student ratio stipulated by the regulations is different, and the energy required to maintain the kindergarten class is too high, so for the boss, the CP value of opening a kindergarten class is not high) So for the parents who send their babies, where should the babies be sent after the baby-sitting center can't accept them? Enter the kindergarten class? However, the rules of the small class are that after the three-year-old is over, you can only enter in the first month of the year. For example, my baby was born in February. After reaching the age of three, he could not enter the small class from February to September of that year, but he had nowhere to turn. Temporary nanny, it is difficult to find a trustworthy and affordable babysitter who is willing to take care of her for only half a year. Kindergarten classes far away from home, but there are too many monks and too little porridge, so they have to queue up and draw lots at present, and there are quite a lot of people in reserve at present, so it can only depend on luck. I also thought about asking the elders in other counties and cities, but the elders who took care of the baby for 24 hours have all had surgery, which is too tiring. What's more, I think even the elders should pay the fee according to the market price, but I can't afford the 24-hour childcare fee. Finally, I thought, bring it yourself. I am the most at ease. However, the period of parental leave is also limited to before the age of three, and I cannot take care of the baby by myself. Therefore, I would like to propose that the period of stay for childcare should be extended by one year, until the age of three is less than four years old, so as to connect with the kindergarten class, so as to help parents in many areas where there are no kindergarten classes, so that they can have another choice."", 'Cancel the provision that child care centers need to withdraw after reaching the age of 2 in the birthday month, and expressly stipulate that it is necessary (compulsory) to continue the child care until the age of 3, so as to facilitate transition into kindergartenAt present, there is no space for childcare centers to continue childcare after the child turns 2 in the birthday month. Although the current regulations state that the childcare center ""has"" to continue childcare until the age of 3, is this ""obligatory"" mandatory? In reality, if the child is born from September to June of the following year, the childcare center will inform in advance that the childcare center cannot continue childcare after the child turns 2 in the month of the birthday. It is very unfriendly and disturbing for parents who have no back-up. Furthermore, although it is possible to find a babysitter, it is possible that the parents have already allocated places for the kindergarten class in the new semester in August. At this time, it is very difficult to find a babysitter who is willing to take care of the child for a short period of time. In addition, frequently changing the environment of the child will cause psychological anxiety. In reality, the problem of childcare during the period from 2 years old to 3 years old is very unfriendly to double-income families. If it is really necessary to ask the childcare to stay, in fact, many companies cannot accept long-term leave. Instead, they will be asked to resign, but parents must have this job. This issue should be actively improved. It is clearly stipulated that if the child in the childcare center has not yet been assigned to a kindergarten or small class, the childcare center must (force) the childcare center to continue the childcare until the age of 3, but the childcare center can help inform parents in advance of the need Find relevant kindergartens and register. Suggestions: 1. Cancel the provision that children in childcare centers who are 2 years old in the month of their birthday must be withdrawn from childcare, and expressly stipulate that if children in childcare centers have not been assigned to kindergarten or small classes, they must (force) the childcare centers to continue childcare until they are 3 years old, or change it to the same semester system as kindergartens, so that children who happen to be 2 years old during the next semester can have a place to continue childcare until the new semester of kindergarten begins (August every year). 2. When the child is about to reach the age of 2, the child care center shall assist the parents to inform the parents in advance of the need to find a suitable kindergarten for registration. 3. The child care center shall allow the child to continue the care until the first semester of the kindergarten (August every year) and the new semester starts after the new semester starts in the month when the child reaches the age of 3.', 'Parents with double salaries and no support need more flexible parental leave: Please relax the parental leave application until the child reaches the age of four, so that the integration of small classes will be smootherThe application period for the current parental leave policy is the day before the child reaches the age of three, the maximum period of leave without pay cannot exceed two years, and the subsidy is 80% of the salary of the first six months of labor insurance. The purpose of this decree is to connect kindergarten classes, but based on the analysis of the current situation, kindergarten classes are not the key projects of kindergartens. Kindergartens in many places do not open Kindergarten classes every year. Due to the different teacher-student ratios stipulated in the current regulations, in the case of two teachers teaching the whip, a small class can only accept a maximum of 16 students, but a small class can accommodate up to 30 students. The energy and threshold required to maintain kindergarten classes is relatively high. Therefore, for kindergarten operators, the opening of kindergarten classes is usually arranged after small classes to senior classes. Only when there are enough places every year will they consider opening special classes for two-year-olds or mixed-age classes for 3-5 years old. Although the childcare center can extend the childcare until the child reaches the age of three, the child must leave the school the day before the age of three. So for the parents who originally sent the baby to the childcare center, where should the baby be sent after the childcare center can\'t take them in and the kindergarten of their choice is not open for kindergarten classes? Obviously, our current regulations have a gap in the connection of childcare for children who are 3 years old but not 4 years old. According to the current laws and regulations, in order to bridge the gap period in childcare for children aged 3 to 4, it seems that there are many options, but in fact there are many difficulties: 1. Temporary nannies: Most nannies prefer long-term childcare because they need to work hard with children and parents. If the child is less than half a year away from the start of the small class, it is very difficult to find a trustworthy babysitter with reasonable fees during such a short window of time. 2. Sending children to nearby kindergartens: In the situation of too many monks and few food, many schools need to queue up and draw lots in advance, and there are quite a lot of people in reserve. Whether or not you can enroll depends on luck. 3. Seek support from the elders: What should we do if the elders are far away from other counties or cities or are old and in poor health and unable to provide assistance? However, the current regulation for small classes in kindergartens is that students can only enter the school in the first month of the year after they have reached the age of three. For example, if the baby is born in April, after reaching the age of three, he has to wait until September of the same year to enter the kindergarten. If the babysitter can only be nursed until the child reaches the age of three, and parents can only apply for parental leave before the child reaches the age of three, what should I do during the window period from April to September? Therefore, here I would like to propose that ""the age limit for applying for parental leave shall be relaxed to before the age of three to the age of four"". In this way, parents with babies who have no back-up on double salaries, cannot successfully attend kindergarten classes, cannot find a babysitter, and cannot attend small classes, can have an additional choice of peace of mind, that is, parents ask short-term baby-care leave without pay, and take care of their children at home.']"

Whenever a typhoon strikes, people's life, life and property are threatened, and the government's decision on whether to take a typhoon holiday to protect the people is often unsatisfactory. Whether to let go or not to let go, people from all walks of life always have different reactions. The media also often make a big fuss, causing panic among the people. The typhoon's original intention is to protect the personal safety of the people, not to allow the media or people with a heart to incite others. In Japan, there is no such regulation as a typhoon. It is often determined by whether the tram is running normally or the business owner. Therefore, it is proposed here through this platform. In the future, whenever a typhoon strikes, the implementation of the typhoon holiday should be left to the enterprises or schools to decide on their own. The government must provide information and typhoon data and place them on the Internet for your reference. And if, after leaving the company or school to decide, there is an improper decision. The government must investigate carefully, negotiate compensation and other matters, and strictly supervise."", 'Do not take holidays on typhoon daysIn fact, there is no need for holidays during typhoon days.

There are two reasons for this. One is because some students will be late, obese, overweight, underweight, malnourished (or unbalanced) due to difficult choices and preferences. Accidents, accidents, external environment, living environment, things happening around, TV programs, etc., which lead to distortions (or development in a bad direction) of the students\' psychology (or spirit). That\'s why I think that in addition to providing nutritious lunches, elementary schools and middle schools should also provide nutritious ""breakfasts"" and regular psychological counseling (counseling) for each student', 'Improve the quality of nutritious lunches in primary and secondary schools across the countryIn addition to schoolchildren who bring bento and steamed bento, most students in junior high and elementary schools grow up in double-income families, and parents cannot help their children make bento after work due to work. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of children eating Chinese food, they can only choose ""nutritious lunches"" that seem to be nutritious but are actually not very nutritious. Although the nutritious lunch has always maintained a ""plenty of quantity"", the quality is not good. Common situations include: the dishes are too wet, the meat is too oily, and the taste is not good, so that they cannot arouse the students\' desire to eat, and because of the poor taste, many students have a shadow in their hearts, causing students to choose ""not to eat lunch"" or ""only eat their favorite dishes"", which will affect the balanced diet and growth and development. Because it is not delicious, the students have no appetite and the leftover dishes are wasted. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education can face up to this situation and supervise the industry to improve the quality, and regularly check the quality of nutritious lunches. It is not necessary to win by quantity, so that students can eat nutritious and healthy without creating food waste and causing waste.', 'Nutritious school lunches are too expensive35 yuan is the amount for a nutritious lunch in Yunlin County. The price is already low enough, but it is not fully used on the ingredients. After deducting the costs of hiring kitchen workers, maintaining equipment, and shipping, the actual cost of ingredients for a child’s meal is less than 25 yuan, and you can’t buy a rice ball in a convenience store. What dishes are in the 35 yuan nutritious lunch? Heavy flavor dishes such as curry chicken, three cup chicken, flower melon chicken, and sesame oil chicken are regular customers. Heavy flavors are often used to cover up ingredients that are not good enough or fresh enough, and to make meals cooked early in the morning less unpalatable at noon. When I actually visited the school and asked the children what their favorite lunch was, curry and fried fish steak were the most frequently heard answers. Inadvertently, this video appeared on the home page and brought back my memories. My dad is actually a cook who can only order nutritious lunches during hours because of his work. At noon, there was no meal. What a wonderful feeling it is to eat home-made bento for the first time. Although there are still minor problems such as steam and vegetable juice, it is far less than the disadvantages of nutritious lunch. It was not until high school, when there was a school discussion to replace the hot food department, that I really understood the inside story. It turns out that in order to recover the commission, the principal will ask the manufacturer to deliberately lower the cost, and of course he will try his best to eat something that ordinary people don\'t like. As far as my current experience of eating out is concerned, in fact, any bento shop at that time was far better than barrel meals (of course, it was more expensive). But thinking about our family’s economy, although it can’t be called rich, there are always middle-class people. It is not easy to be rejected by the vast majority of people, but this issue has rarely been paid attention to. Sometimes I am envious of children in remote areas. The ingredients are fresh, and someone helps to cook them. They don’t have to worry about health problems. This meal cost less than 30 yuan. When parents hear their children say ""delicious"" in unison, can they not feel nervous? The school lunch fee in Kaohsiung City has been increased by 2 yuan starting from August 1. It is estimated that if the meal is provided for 22 days per month, parents will increase the burden by 44 yuan per month. Starting from the 2017 school year (August), Kaohsiung’s nutritious lunch fee base adjustment has been adjusted to 42 yuan for elementary schools, 45 yuan for junior high schools, and 47 yuan for high schools. ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️The main reason is that it is too expensive⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️']"

However, recently, I can't bear to see European and American medical personnel who lack protective materials and risk their lives to stand on the front line. Taiwan is a kind country. When the world encountered disasters in the past, we always used the spirit of being hungry and drowning others, and spared no effort to help the world. Now the government is sharing Taiwan's experience in epidemic prevention with the world, and there are also some kind-hearted people in Taiwan who are willing to donate part of their three weekly mask quotas to help European and American medical staff. Therefore, it is suggested that the government add an option to donate masks in the mask pre-order system, so that interested people can choose the number of masks they want to donate. For example, if you buy three masks that week, if you choose to donate one, you will get two masks in the end, but you pay for three masks, and the donated masks will be donated by the government to the countries in need. It could even allow people to choose the country they want to donate to, if appropriate, or let the government decide.

In view of the relevant situation, the price of masks in Taiwan is cheap, and the price of masks in China is high due to the serious epidemic situation.

Please reopen the school nurses and still have the right to purchase masks under the real-name system just like other medical staff. Event lazy bag: 1. School nurses have 5 masks per week, but they can no longer purchase 3 masks per week under the real-name system. 2. In addition to the masks provided by the government, medical institutions can still purchase 3 masks per week with their real names. 3. School protective masks are not only for personal use at work, but also for general epidemic prevention and emergency backup in some schools. 4. School nurses are also medical staff and should not be treated differently from medical staff in medical institutions. They are the front line of community epidemic prevention.

Full text: On 3/24, the State Educational Administration of the Ministry of Education issued an official letter (National Educational Administration, March 24, 109 Taijiao Guoshui Xuezi No. 1090034181 Letter) Subject: Please follow the instructions for filling in the information required for the distribution of masks for school nurses and drivers. Please refer to it. In the instructions, it is clearly pointed out: Considering the official needs of the school nurses and drivers, each person is allocated 5 masks per day, but for the sake of fairness, the above-mentioned personnel will make a note of their use. Therefore, after receiving them, they are no longer allowed to purchase 3 masks per week through the real-name system. 1. Are school nurses considered medical staff? From the relevant webpages of the county and city governments, we learned that the units that can be equipped with masks include: hospitals, clinics (including obstetrics and gynecology and kidney dialysis clinics), various medical associations (such as the Association of Chinese Physicians, the Association of Nurses and Nurses, and the Association of Medical Examiners, etc.), respiratory treatment and hearing institutions, long-term care institutions (including residential care homes, general/postpartum care homes, long-term care A bases, dementia bases, etc.), mental care homes. Whether it is an acute hospital clinic or a long-term care institution, all medical personnel can have the number of masks allocated by the government when working in a medical institution, and ""do not need to register with a health insurance card."" If the medical personnel can be directly provided with masks without registering their health insurance cards, why do school nurses need to register their health insurance cards for the masks they are issued? The fairness mentioned in the official letter is actually not fair at all. 2. How long is the service life of the mask? Generally speaking, the inner layer of the mask needs to be replaced when it gets wet, but now is an extraordinary period and requires extraordinary measures. Therefore, many ways to extend the life of the mask, such as the inner layer of the mask, mask cover, electric pot sterilization, etc., have been released. However, have you ever thought that the problem lies in the amount of virus accumulated on the outer layer of the mask? ! Yes, perhaps electric cooker sterilization can help eliminate more than 90% of germs. If it is really effective and feasible, why do doctors on duty ration 10 masks a week? Of course, the frequency of use of masks is too high, and the amount of contact with medical personnel is large and complicated. Protecting them is protecting ourselves. Why do medical staff in medical institutions still have the right to purchase real-name masks in addition to the daily ration masks? Because these frontline combatants don\'t have masks when they are on vacation! ! ! 3. Personal use or public use? The 5 masks used by the school nurses a week, in some schools, in addition to the daily needs of the school nurses, must be used for general epidemic prevention and emergency backup, that is, when teachers and students in the school have urgent needs, they must be deducted from them.']"

We can see from this (2015) Ninth Three Military Parade hosted by President Xi Jinping of the Communist Party of China: the PLA has produced all its elite weapons, 84% of which made their debut, and there are a total of more than 500 new weapons, including chariots (""King of Land Warfare"" 99A main battle tanks), various missiles (""Dongfeng 21D"" has a range targeting the first and second island chains, and is dubbed the ""aircraft carrier killer""; Military experts call them ""Guam Express"" and ""Dongfeng 5B"" intercontinental missiles, which have a range of more than 14,000 kilometers and can directly attack the mainland of the United States. ""Dongfeng 16"", also known as ""Okinawa Express"", has a range of up to the U.S. base in Okinawa in Japan. Among the 1,700 missiles aimed at Taiwan, there are also ""Dongfeng 21C"", ""Dongfeng 15B"") and various artillery and drones. , J-31 stealth fighter jets are the most eye-catching), the CCP’s 1993 military parade is huge, it is full of meaning to show off military power to Europe, the United States and other countries, and it also has a strong intention to intimidate Taiwan. Therefore, in fact, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s current military strength, ships (including the Liaoning aircraft carrier), weapons, equipment, missiles, and fighter jets are capable of attacking Taiwan at any time (you can know from the combat strength displayed by the Communist Party of China in the September 3rd military parade), and there is no need to wait until 2020 to have the ability to invade Taiwan on a large scale. In addition, the unscrupulous soldiers sold military secrets on national defense to the CCP on the other side. I believe the CCP knows what it should know. Are you fighting? The national army spends a lot of money on the ""Han Kuang Exercise"" and the purchase of various weapons and equipment every year. I really don\'t know how much it will add to the defense of Taiwan and Penghu? Under the current national army recruitment system, private second-class volunteers have more than 33,000 yuan per month, not to mention that the monthly salaries of volunteer non-commissioned officers, lieutenants, school officers, and generals may be several times the salaries of ordinary office workers in society. Isn’t such a high salary enough for these soldiers to support their families? Why sell military secrets to the CCP on the other side, and be a traitor with a long history? The national army has gone through ""refined cases"", ""progressive cases"" and ""exquisite cases"", and upholding the spirit of ""retaining the superior and weeding out the inferior"" has established a small-scale, high-quality, and powerful force. It stands to reason that the remaining volunteer officers and soldiers in the army should be the elite among the elite. Why do so many cases of leakage (violation) of secrets still occur? Is the national army\'s standard of ""retaining the superior and eliminating the inferior"" different from the public\'s perception? Could it be that the so-called ""superior"" of the national army are the generals who betrayed their wives and built love nests with the communist spies, who couldn\'t stand the temptation of the CCP\'s money and beauty, and then sold national defense and military secrets to the CCP, or were they the school officers, lieutenants and non-commissioned officers who lived a corrupt life, spent extravagantly, couldn\'t make ends meet, were heavily in debt, and then sold military secrets to the CCP in exchange for monetary rewards? The national army is responsible for protecting the people, and the country allocates so much of the people’s tax money to the national defense budget every year for the national army to train troops in the way of fighting, equipping, organizing, and training, and according to the needs of Taiwan and Penghu defense operations, research various tactics and purchase all kinds of weapons and equipment. The life of the family is at stake.', 'Invite the Ministry of National Defense and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to develop low-cost asymmetric defense weaponsRecently, China\'s Xi Jinping proposed ""one country, two systems"" and will not give up the idea of \u200b\u200bunifying Taiwan by force. Most of the people in Taiwan are against it, and the relationship between the two sides seems to be tense. However, due to Taiwan\'s manpower and resource constraints, such as purchasing too many expensive defense weapons may not necessarily achieve the best defense capability. Although self-developed high-cost weapons are one direction, due to the high investment cost, there are also easy to be fraudulent. Submarine national manufacturing is an example. Therefore, it is suggested that the Ministry of National Defense and the Chinese Academy of Sciences should develop low-cost asymmetric defense weapons as soon as possible to achieve maximum defense capabilities at the lowest cost. For example: (1) air-dropped petrol bombs with simple tracking guidance. Aerial gasoline bombs can be air-dropped at high altitudes outside the enemy\'s range. There is a miniature camera and a microcontroller at the front of the bomb body to control the tail to adjust the direction to track the target, and it can emit gasoline or flammable liquid at an appropriate height above the target. The target is an aircraft carrier as an example. Several gasoline bombs can be airdropped first, and then the bombs are dropped to ignite the gasoline. Once the deck is engulfed in flames, the aircraft carrier will lose its function even if it does not sink. (2) Based on the ARRC forward-looking rocket, ask the government to provide funds to subsidize its research and development, and it can be converted into a low-cost missile worth tens of thousands of yuan in wartime. (3) Modify the aerial camera so that it can meet the requirements of anti-electromagnetic interference during combat, and install small bombs. Form an air defense network. The enemy also intends to convert old fighter planes into drones to join the battle. It would not be cost-effective for Taiwan to attack with tens of millions of missiles. Therefore, tracking and navigation technology should be controlled below 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to meet the asymmetrical requirements of the Taiwan Strait war. At present, a commercial mobile phone worth 5,000 yuan can have a camera, an accelerometer, and a microcontroller, etc., as long as a 5,000 yuan tail control mechanism and a metal shell to resist electromagnetic interference are added. (4) Based on the technology of toy submarines, research and develop small underwater unmanned submarines to establish underwater defense capabilities. (5) Establish an induction grid system around the island. Once the grid is damaged, it will immediately give an alarm and indicate the location of the invasion, so that the national army can carry out the most effective defense with the smallest manpower. (6) In the past, we have heard of the casualties caused by Vietnamese people touching landmines by mistake. Therefore, laying landmines is not recommended in principle. However, if it is necessary to lay landmines during wartime, the national army should detonate the landmines by remote control when it is confirmed as an enemy. When laying landmines, a mine location database should be established immediately to facilitate post-war clearing. The communication between the landmine and the remote controller is carried out through optical fiber, and the mine will automatically detonate before the battery is almost exhausted.', 'Transfer the Air Force S-2T anti-submarine aircraft to the Air Force Corps of the Ministry of the Interior to strengthen disaster prevention and rescue capabilitiesThe Anti-submarine Warfare Brigade of the 439th Mixed Wing of the Air Force Command of the Ministry of National Defense currently has 10 S-2T ""Turbo Tracker"" anti-submarine patrol aircraft. After purchasing the successor model P-3C ""Orion"" anti-submarine patrol aircraft, all S-2T aircraft will be eliminated in 2010. After the foreign military aircraft of the same type were decommissioned, Canada, the United States and France converted them into aerial fire extinguishers, and used them as an important disaster prevention and rescue asset for pre-emptive strikes and rapid fire extinguishing when forest fires occur. Today, there are still 23 of the same type of aircraft in the California Forest Service (CAL FRIE), and 9 in the Civil Defense Security Agency of the French Ministry of the Interior (Sécurité Civile). According to the suggestions put forward in the ""2014 Air Science and Technology and Aviation Safety Academic Symposium"" held by the Air Force Aviation Technology College on May 30, 2014, in the ""Discussion on my country\'s Air Rescue Energy"": 1. Our country should build fixed-wing aircraft search energy. In addition to maritime search tasks, it can also support the routine air patrol tasks of the Coast Guard. 2. The number of ""rescue at sea"" missions of the Air Crew Corps is the highest among all missions, and there has been ""almost no investment"" in airborne search equipment for many years. The effect of ""search"" is not good, which also affects the efficiency of ""rescue"". In addition, according to the ""Disaster Prevention and Rescue Application Technology Plan 103 Annual Plan Interview and Platform Communication Meeting"" of the Agriculture, Forestry and Aeronautical Survey Institute of the Forestry Bureau of the Council of Agriculture on August 4, 2013, it was pointed out: 1. The Biqi King Air B350 model of the Air Crew Corps, numbered B-13153, has been equipped with an airborne synthetic aperture radar system in accordance with the plan of the Council of Agriculture. Because the radar is sophisticated and large, it is difficult to disassemble and assemble. Therefore, the B350 model B-13153 cannot perform other aerial photography task. 2. Another B200 aircraft numbered B-13152 of the Air Crew Corps is old, and it is recommended to purchase a new aircraft. It can be seen that the Air Service Corps of the Ministry of the Interior, as a unit for the unified and centralized use of national aircraft, has only one fixed-wing fleet since its establishment. It has only one Beech King Air B200 and one B350 aerial survey aircraft. There are no aerial fire-fighting aircraft and sea patrol aircraft (SAR). The number of fixed-wing aircraft that can perform aerial fire-fighting or maritime search and rescue is ""zero"". Aircrews are chronically underinvested in maintenance, maritime search and rescue, and disaster preparedness. The content of this proposal is: retain the Air Force\'s decommissioned S-2T fleet, and transfer it to the Air Force Corps together with backup parts and related technical documents. The Executive Yuan convened the Air Force Command of the Ministry of National Defense, the Air Force Corps of the Ministry of the Interior, and the Coast Guard to jointly study the requirements and specifications for the performance improvement and modification of the S-2T model. Evaluate the demand and the number of refits with scientific methods, and seal up the remaining airframes for backup and dismantling. Some active S-2T pilots who have not been retrained and P-3C will be retired. Together with the pilots who have retired in the past ten years, if they are combined with training on the benefits and pensions of the Navy and Air Force when they are transferred to the Air Corps, they can provide sufficient incentives to obtain enough mature and ready-made pilots. The cost of pilot acquisition and retraining is low. The Air Force is requested to provide the research data on the conversion of the S-2T into an aerial fire extinguisher in the past as a reference. The S-2T aircraft undergoes major repairs, upgrades the digital glass cockpit, installs GPS, air conditioning, purchases related mission equipment, improves safety, and provides a basic ""humane"" working environment for the crew. In line with this case, increase the staffing of the Air Crew Corps to provide sufficient manpower for operations. If there is an airframe that is decided to be eliminated due to poor condition, one will be kept for the reconstruction of the Taoyuan Aviation Science Museum and provided as a collection for popular science education, historical data preservation, and national defense purposes. From the beginning of this case, before the aircrafts of the Ministry of National Defense, the Air Force Corps, and the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications of _x0003_ want to be phased out, a system should be established to conduct an overall assessment of the reutilization of residual benefits, and horizontally contact units with needs as a reference for whether to transfer them to other government units for re-use, so as to save huge amounts of public funds by making the best use of them. This proposal was previously sent to the Mailbox of the Presidential Office. Letter No. 20150005857 was transferred from the Presidential Office to the Mailbox of the President of the Executive Yuan for processing. The Executive Yuan sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior with letter No. 010-104006835. However, the Air Crew Corps rejected it on the grounds that ""the aircraft is old and does not meet the Air Force\'s combat needs"" without scientific evaluation, which shows the rigidity of the government system to the people\'s suggestions. In addition, the Air Crew Corps may not be able to decide on the budget requirements of this case, and it needs the support of the central government to implement the project.']"

It can prevent addicts from throwing cigarette butts away.In order to improve the littering of cigarette butts, if cigarette buyers must bring the same number of cigarette butts they want to buy, smokers will recycle the cigarette butts instead of littering. Sellers must first apply to the Environmental Protection Bureau for the quantity of cigarettes to be sold, and then return the same amount of cigarette butts when purchasing the goods before they can repurchase, so as to improve the situation of smokers littering cigarette butts.', ""Cigarette butts cannot be thrown away for freeGiving value to cigarette butts can only be repurchased by recycling. Plastic bags cannot be taken for free, and cigarette butts cannot be thrown away for free. I propose to abandon the judicial means of punishment and sanctions, and instead use economic power to curb the behavior of littering cigarette butts. Give value to cigarette butts, and use recycling as a means to eliminate cigarette butt garbage and indirectly reduce the use of tobacco products. 1. Phenomena and Difficulties (1) The huge amount of cigarette butts should not be underestimated. Cigarette butts rank first in all types of garbage. Moreover, cigarette butts are poisonous and cannot be decomposed naturally; moreover, due to their small size, cigarette butts are not easy to remove, and the influence of pollution is even more serious. And a single spark is enough to start a prairie fire, which is also one of the reasons for public danger. (2) Difficulty in investigation, and the useless smoking area Although it can be investigated or reported in accordance with the Waste Cleaning Law, the inspectors are not enough and the laws and regulations are not effective: 1. The number of inspectors is limited. And the habit of throwing things around has been formed, and I have developed a fluke mentality that I think it's a small treachery and a little evil, and it's no big deal. If the society continues to tolerate the use of judicial appeals and arrests as a means, the ban will never be exhausted, and it will not be practical. 2. The difficulty lies in proving the littering of cigarette butts only happened in an instant, and in order to arrest the active criminal, the police must be present together to successfully report the crime, and the cost of law enforcement is too high. Even if public video reports are used, if there is no identification mark or license plate number of the active offender, the case cannot be closed. There are regulations, but enforcement is difficult and unsustainable. 3. The special area is useless. It is useless to set up smoking areas or widely set up trash cans. Unless the number of special areas is so large that they are pervasive and everywhere, the drop-in-hand layout will not change the bad habits. It will only waste public money, which is neither practical nor fair to other non-smoking taxpayers. (3) Moral persuasion is nowhere near itching. The existing decree only emphasizes the health hazards of tobacco products, but there is no mention of the environmental hazards. Even advocating the waste removal law will not deter smokers from breaking the rules. Law enforcement is not clear, and the public power is doing nothing, which gradually leads to the deterioration of the law-abiding concept and moral atmosphere. The smoking habits of smokers may be maintained, but the behavior of littering cigarette butts is not a right that should be protected. (4), smoking ban is nowhere in sight. The country needs taxation, and trade balance must also be taken into account. But national health cannot be ignored. As a result, such a phenomenon is caused: on the one hand, the economic department collects taxes and taxes through tobacco products, and on the other hand, it pays the price of tobacco damage from the health and welfare department; the left hand sells cigarettes and the right hand bans smoking, which is contradictory and embarrassing. Judging from the current phenomenon, laws and penalties lack deterrent resistance, while moral persuasion is nowhere close to being banned. I propose to give value to cigarette butts by means of economics, so that waste can be reduced. Although it cannot be banned, it can indirectly reduce the amount of use without affecting taxation. Second, the implementation method (1), when consumers purchase tobacco products, they need to return the original relative quantity of cigarette butts, packaging boxes and other garbage. (2) If it cannot be done, the purchase price will be forced to double or triple. Plastic bags cannot be taken for free, and cigarette butts cannot be thrown away for free. If consumers discard wastes such as cigarette butts and packaging boxes at will, even if they are not banned, according to this implementation method, it will cost a lot of money. In order not to make life difficult for the wallet, cigarette butts cannot be discarded at will, because they are valuable. In this way, garbage can naturally be reduced, and the concentrated cigarette butts are easier to dispose of."", ""Cigarette butts should be recycled by cigarette manufacturersIn order to curb the discarding of cigarette butts, I propose that cigarette butts must be recycled, and tobacco manufacturers are responsible for the implementation. When consumers buy tobacco products, they need to return the original quantity of cigarette butts and packaging boxes before they can buy as usual, otherwise the price will double. Premium portion goes to garbage disposal. This is tantamount to establishing a concept: cigarette butts are valuable and cannot be discarded easily; discarding is equal to losing money. Abandoning the legal means of punishment and sanctions, and consciously and systematically assigning value to cigarette butts can not only reduce garbage, but also gradually reduce the use of tobacco products without affecting taxation. Just as plastic bags cannot be taken for free, cigarette butts cannot be thrown away for free. The description is as follows: 1. Phenomena and difficulties (1) Difficulty in checking and arresting Cigarette butts occupy the first place in the total number of all kinds of garbage. Cigarette butts are poisonous and cannot be decomposed naturally; moreover, because of their small size, cigarette butts are not easy to remove and have a serious impact. And a single spark is enough to start a prairie fire, which is also one of the reasons for public danger. Although the behavior of throwing away can be investigated or reported according to the Waste Cleaning Law, the inspectors are of little help and the law is not effective: 1. The number of inspectors is limited. And it has been a long-standing habit of throwing away casually, thinking that the small treachery and evil that happen once in a while are no big deal, and I am lucky. If the society continues to tolerate it and use judicial appeals and investigations as means, the ban will never be exhausted, and it is not practical. 2. The difficulty lies in proving the littering of cigarette butts only happened in an instant, and in order to arrest the active criminal, the police must be present together to successfully report the crime, and the cost of law enforcement is too high. Even if public video reports are used, if there is no identification mark or license plate number of the active offender, the case cannot be closed. Regulations exist, but enforcement is difficult and unsustainable. 3. The special area is useless. It is useless to set up smoking areas or widely set up trash cans. Unless the number of special areas is so large that they are pervasive and everywhere, a drop in the bucket and superficial layout will not change bad habits. It will only waste public funds, which is impractical and unfair to other non-smoking taxpayers. (2) Moral persuasion is nowhere close. The existing decree only emphasizes the health hazards of tobacco products, but there is no mention of the environmental hazards. Even advocating the waste removal law will not deter smokers from breaking the rules. The law enforcement is not clear, and the public power is resigned, which gradually leads to the deterioration of the law-abiding concept and moral atmosphere of the society, which is the most shameful failure of the people's education. The smoking habit of smokers is a legal right. Although it should be maintained, the behavior of littering cigarette butts is not a right that should be protected. (3), smoking ban is nowhere in sight. Tobacco products are different from general commodities. They are a source of taxation, but consume medical resources at the expense of health, resulting in such a phenomenon: on the one hand, the economic department collects taxes from the sale of tobacco products, and on the other hand, pays the price of tobacco damage from the health and welfare department; the left hand sells cigarettes and the right hand bans smoking, which is contradictory and embarrassing. The use of smoking products also causes environmental pollution. Before the complete ban on smoking products, extraordinary measures must be taken to deal with the pollution problem. Judging from the current phenomenon, laws and penalties lack deterrence, moral persuasion is barely there, and prohibition is far away. I propose that cigarette butts must be recycled, and cigarette manufacturers are responsible for the implementation. Using economics as a means to give value to cigarette butts can reduce garbage. Although it cannot be banned in a short period of time, it can indirectly reduce the amount of use without affecting taxation, killing two birds with one stone and killing two birds with one stone. Second, method (1), when consumers purchase tobacco products, they need to return the original relative quantity of cigarette butts and packaging boxes before they can purchase as usual. (2) If the requirements of Article 1 cannot be met, the purchase price will be forced to double or triple. Just as plastic bags cannot be taken for free, cigarette butts cannot be thrown away for free. If consumers discard cigarette butts, packaging boxes and other waste at will, even if they are not banned, according to this implementation method, it will cost a lot of money. In order not to make life difficult for the purse, cigarette butts cannot be discarded at will, because they are valuable. In this way, garbage can naturally be reduced, and the concentrated cigarette butts are easier to dispose of. (3) Execution manpower and funds The tobacco product supplier proposes the plan, arranges the manpower and is responsible for the implementation. Tobacco product suppliers include importers, distributors, and distributors of various sales locations. Having the ability to recycle is a necessary condition for the sale of tobacco products, otherwise it is not possible to engage in the sale of tobacco products. The source of funds for execution is supported by the premium income. Arrange the distribution ratio of supply chain at each level in the execution plan. Third, explanation (1), smokers must be responsible for their own actions and bear the burden of polluting the environment. The garbage produced by oneself should be disposed of by oneself, otherwise you have to pay the price. (2) The current price of tobacco products is too low, which has long been criticized by people; however, if it is suddenly increased by a large amount, it will be unreasonable and likely to cause opposition. However, if you give value to cigarette butts, explain the legitimacy of garbage disposal on the grounds of eliminating garbage, and raise the price but not the price, then you will be famous. Smokers will have no position to rebound, and those who abide by the rules will not be affected at all. (3) The extra difference between one and two times the premium can be used for inspection and garbage disposal expenses. At the beginning of the policy implementation, it may be covered by a part of the cigarette donation, but after a period of time, the excess difference will definitely be self-sufficient.""]"

The sender on the overseas fraudulent package is the so-called ""logistics company, collection operation, transfer station...etc"" and they all claim to be ""not the seller"". The warehouses of the shipping companies are filled with thousands of packages, all of which are counterfeit or low-quality products. There is nothing wrong with all of them entering Taiwan legally, but who will help them get them in? That is, the customs broker that assists in customs clearance. It turned out that when they were shipped to Taiwan, it was already the first step of fraud. The customs broker used a dummy head to declare at the customs. After the customs clearance was passed, the shipping company got a list of real bidders to help send the goods out. After receiving the payment for the goods, they laundered the money back to the mainland. These fraudulent packages all entered Taiwan legally. The ""Simple Customs Declaration"" currently implemented allows customs brokers to walk through the gray area. They claim to help the shipping company declare customs, without a power of attorney, but directly declare with a head account, falsifying forged documents. False declarations and even tax evasion are already in the legal gray area in front of us. Fraud groups operate aboveboard and can almost shake the country’s illegal customs clearance.

Why these fraudulent packages can enter Taiwan legally? It turns out that someone behind the scenes is helping. The current ""simple customs declaration"" allows the customs brokers to walk through the gray area. They claim to help the shipping company to declare customs. Without a power of attorney, they directly declare with a head account, and falsify the documents. Most of the victims did not know that the fraudulent package was an overseas package. Of course, they did not know that they had to declare at customs, and they did not appoint a customs broker to declare at customs. Reported to the Ministry of Finance that the sender did not issue an invoice, did not appoint a customs broker, and was declared to the customs under a false name, but the Customs Service responded with an official answer, asking the victim to contact the customs broker by himself, and did nothing at all, and did not check or send a letter to the reported company! How can victims report to Customs? Facebook is not a shopping platform, but it has opened another Marketplace trading platform, which allows people to advertise and shop, and there is no return mechanism at all. Facebook should be included in the management of the shopping platform. Facebook must be responsible for inspection and joint responsibility for its Marketplace trading platform and advertisements, and establish a complete return mechanism. Home delivery operators and super-commercial operators should clearly indicate the correct contact information of the sender for overseas cash-on-delivery packages, and establish a refund mechanism, which can be refunded to the victim within 7 days. Buying brand-name products advertised, but receiving non-branded products from mainland China, or receiving parcels without shopping, all of these should be classified as fraud and fraud. The senders of the fraudulent packages are all companies that have registered cases in Taiwan. These so-called ""logistics companies, collection operations, and transfer stations"" should be included in the control, and there should be special channels for complaints from competent authorities. (Complaints from the Ministry of Economic Affairs are unacceptable). The sender of the package should refund the package within 15 days of the victim’s request to return the goods, and provide the victim with a “customs broker” to declare the package to Taiwan, so that the victim can report to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. If there are more than 10 fraudulent package disputes within 3 months, the competent authority must take the initiative to suspend its business. The contents of overseas fraudulent packages are dazzling, including food, skin care products, health food, electronic cigarettes, etc. Do these need to be inspected by relevant health units?

A certain amount of money can be refunded on the grounds that the international shipping fee needs to be deducted. If the consumer refuses to deduct the payment, the consumer will be threatened to find the seller to apply for a refund. It is stated in the home delivery regulations that the sender must completely fill in all the information before delivery is allowed. However, the delivery slips of this type of shopping fraud often only fill in the name of the customs broker, and even do not fill in the name of the sender at all. It is obviously a cover-up in order to prevent consumers from contacting the sender. The one-page shopping advertisement advertises that the goods can be unpacked and inspected before payment, but in fact, because home delivery companies and customs brokers mark the delivery slips as not to be unpacked and inspected, consumers have to pay before they can open the package before seeing the actual condition of the product, which seriously affects the rights and interests of consumers.

Public reporting is not the ultimate goal of maintaining traffic safety, it is just a process. It\'s okay to limit public reporting, but the government should show courage and make ""reducing traffic fatalities and injuries"" the primary goal of governance. Taiwan\'s traffic needs to be completely improved, from road planning that conforms to traffic equality thinking (pedestrian and bicycle lanes that are as smooth as a driveway, friendly public transportation, etc.), driver\'s license system, violation point system, strengthened management of professional driving, traffic education for the public, and effective law enforcement, etc., all need to be completely abolished and retrained.

Although illegal parking does not seem serious, casual Internet users can find cases of people being chased and killed by vehicles trying to avoid illegal parking on the side of the road. If even static traffic violations cannot be effectively curbed, let alone dynamic violations that are more difficult to ban. The above-mentioned ""outsourced"" commissioners to ban ""static violations"", in fact, Taiwan already has such personnel - ""traffic assistants"". The establishment of this officer is based on item 2 of Article 7 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Punishment"": ""The inspection in the preceding paragraph may be carried out with the assistance of ""traffic assistants"". If the inspection item is ""illegal parking"", it may be directly implemented by ""traffic assistants"". . According to Article 3 of the ""Administrative Measures for Traffic Assistants"", traffic assistants are employed by police stations, traffic bureaus or related agencies. Article 4 clearly stipulates its work items. In addition to directly implementing the inspection of ""illegal parking"", it can also assist in the inspection of ""road traffic management"".

Only those who have obtained the qualifications can serve as ""traffic assistants"" to ensure that the personnel have sufficient knowledge of traffic laws.

I believe everyone is familiar with the figure of ""street parking biller"" shuttling through the streets and alleys to bill.

If the public attempts to attack or intimidate the staff, they will be punished according to the crime of ""obstructing public affairs"". It is hoped that the government can consider and adopt the above suggestions and revise the ""Administrative Measures for Traffic Assistants"" to make it more perfect.

(2) Turning right at a red light (turning right at a red light: Item 2 of Article 53, a fine ranging from NT$600 to NT$1,800), the current actual fine is NT$600. The former (1) has not yet passed the intersection, so in fact it is not easy to cause vehicle collisions at the intersection, and accidents are not easy to occur; the latter (2) has entered the intersection and is turning, which often causes frightened or chased vehicles with green lights. However, both are equally dangerous to pedestrians walking on crosswalks. However, the penalty for crossing the stop line is 900 yuan, but the fine for turning right on a red light is only 600 yuan, which is obviously not in proportion to the degree of harm. Since running a red light can be fined 1,800-2,700 yuan, at least turning right on a red light (which is also a type of red light running) should be fined 1,200 yuan (also in line with the 600-1,800 yuan in item 2 of Article 53). The principle of ""heavier than passing the stop line, but lighter than going straight through the red light"" can also reduce the accidents caused by turning right on the red light.', 'Considering the economic development and the control effect of traffic regulations, traffic fines should be increasedA large part of the amount of fines in the current Road Traffic Management Penalty Regulations was set on May 13, 1975, which is obviously low. Let’s review the history first, taking Article 55’s temporary parking penalty as an example. When the law was amended on July 17, 1970, the fine was 50-100 silver dollars, equivalent to 150-300 NT dollars. When the law was amended on May 13, 1975, the fine was 100-200 silver dollars, equivalent to 300-600 NT dollars. After 34 years, the purchasing power of money has changed drastically, and the original amount of fines has been significantly lower, losing its deterrent and preventive functions. From the perspective of basic salary, starting from November 1, 1975, the basic salary is 6,900 yuan per month. From January 1, 2011, the monthly basic salary was adjusted to 24,000 yuan. The basic salary has been increased by 3.48 times. Therefore, the fine amount should also be increased by 3.48 times to maintain the same effect. If we only consider the relationship between fines and purchasing power to measure whether the fines are appropriate, then the traffic fines in this country are obviously seriously low. Take passenger cars ""parking in places where temporary parking is prohibited"" (Article 56) as an example, Japan fines 18,000 yen, and the price of McDonald\'s Big Mac in Japan is 390 yen. The magnification is 46.15 times. Taiwan fined 900 Taiwan dollars, Taiwan McDonald\'s Big Mike sells for 72 Taiwan dollars. The magnification is 12.5 times. Being fined once in Japan is equivalent to losing 46.15 Big Mikes, while being fined once in Taiwan is only equivalent to losing 12.5 Big Mikes. Based on this standard, Taiwan\'s fine should be increased by 3.69 times. Taiwan\'s traffic chaos has become world-renowned, and it has been listed as a travel warning by other advanced countries, and it is one of Taiwan\'s national humiliations. Therefore, it is urgent to increase the fine. In the past, fines were counted in silver dollars, so most of the current fines are divisible by 3. I suggest that most of the fines be increased by (10/3) times, that is, 300 becomes 1000, 900 becomes 3000, and a small number of fines may be exceptions.', 'Traffic fines are too low, and there is no deterrence, causing many people to have no awareness of law-abiding.

It is hoped that the government will make the best policy that can respond to the protection of sex workers and the human rights commitment.Why is the criminalization of sex work a human rights issue? Respecting the autonomy and self-determination of sex workers is completely inconsistent with society, the whole people, and government agencies. This second motion emphasizes that this has not been implemented. Criminalizing consensual sex between adults, including the transaction of sexual services, is incompatible with the human rights to individual autonomy and privacy. In short, it's not for the government to tell consenting adults under what conditions they can have sex. Adopting a different approach from the central and local governments will not give the people a very correct perception, and the problem has not yet been resolved. The country promotes this policy because it places minors and adults on different issues, as a direction of thinking, using correct and open issues, based on the social patterns that different age groups must recognize. To show that the country is not kidnapped by culture, and to deepen the importance of the country to the mainstream society of the people. Continue to face it with an evasive attitude, reflecting the influence of various factors, allowing Taiwan to accumulate more social problems in sex education. In addition to affecting sex workers, it also affects other human rights. In countries where sex work is illegal, it is difficult for sex workers to organize trade unions to fight for their rights, and they cannot support each other and unite to protect themselves. Ensure that sex workers are not discriminated against, either in law or in practice. At the same time, services for sex workers should be strengthened to ensure that they enjoy safe working conditions and be included in public welfare and social safety nets; in this way, the role of the government can be fully played without violating human rights. In order to promote gender mainstreaming business, promote substantive equality of different gender status, eliminate gender discrimination, and protect human rights, whether sex workers who have the same problems, long-standing social groups, pay more attention to show that the country is promoting mainstream business, and the country implements the promotion of human rights. Specially set up the gender equality task force of the Ministry of Justice. Why not take advantage of the trend to promote the elimination of discrimination and unfair human rights treatment related to gender in the industry. Furthermore, any regulation and regulation of sex workers and their activities must be consistent with international human rights law and must not be discriminatory. For example, regulations that discourage sex workers from organizing unions or working in a safe environment are undue restrictions. The Hope Policy aims to call for a renewed focus in the law on combating exploitation, abuse and human trafficking, rather than a blanket criminalization that criminalizes sex workers and endangers their survival."", 'The use of mobile phones or the Internet to seek sex transactions will be legalized and will not be banned1. Before the establishment of the sex trade zone, sex trade service providers can publish advertisements on mobile phones or the Internet, and sex trade recipients can publish announcements. After both parties agree, go to the hotel or the sex trade recipient\'s home to trade. One of the reasons for not setting up a special area is that the nearby people will object. Since the people will object and the government has agreed that sex trafficking is legal, why insist on being in the special area. What\'s more, some prostitution service providers or sex trafficking recipients don\'t like to go to the special area. They are regarded as going to the sex trade and are discriminated against at a glance. If the central government objects, please use this opinion as a public opinion survey. In addition to ordinary telephone polls, you can also conduct online polls on government websites to make a decision. 2. Before setting up a special area, the police are not allowed to search for information on the sex trade on the Internet and then conduct a temporary inspection to ban it, so as to avoid people complaining that the government has no time to set up a special area. If the police want to ban it again, it is simply handed over to the police department to find out where to set up a special zone and set it up. The time limit is one year, and if it cannot be found or established by then, the police shall not crack down on the sex trade outside the special area. If the central government objects, please use this opinion as a public opinion survey. In addition to ordinary telephone polls, you can also conduct online polls on government websites to make a decision. 3. To establish a special area, it is enough to plan the area that is already engaged in the sex industry as a special area, and there is no need to find a new area at all. According to Article 75 of the Local Institutional Law, ""...a municipality, county (city), township (town, city) should act or fail to act in accordance with the law, causing serious harm to the public interest or hindering the normal operation of local government affairs. If it is suitable to handle it on its behalf, the Executive Yuan, the competent central authorities, and the county government may order them to do it within a certain period of time; if they still fail to act within the time limit, they may act on their behalf..."" There is no special area that seriously endangers the public interest, so the central government should have established it on its behalf. The central government should order that if local governments still refuse to be established and still be banned within one year, the central government can delete the appropriations to local governments (such as overall allocation funds), and the central government can use this fund to set up special areas. 4. Ask the central government to amend the law to return the obligation to set up a sex trade zone back to the central government, because the local government has refused to set it up so far, and the central government has not handled it on its behalf. There are no polls showing that the public thinks that the establishment of special zones is an obligation of the local government. If the central government is unwilling to take responsibility, polls should be conducted to understand the public\'s belief that the special zones should be established by the central or local governments. 5. The central government agrees that the sex trade is legal, but pushes the obligation to set up special zones to the local governments. It is better to authorize local governments to decide on their own how to solve the problem of sexual transactions? Firstly, the sex trade service providers can advertise through the Internet or mobile phones, and the sex trade recipients can make announcements through the Internet or mobile phones. Then set up a special area, or find other solutions. 6. The government sets up websites for finding sex partners (including sex transactions and non-sex transactions) to make it easy for both parties to sex transactions to find sex partners, but must log in with a natural person certificate. 7. Before the legalization of communication sex transactions, delete the items related to the prohibition of sex transactions in the police performance evaluation.', 'Set up a sex zone in the form of a government operation buildingThe Social Security Law has been revised for many years, but so far no local government is willing to set up a sex zone, which has damaged the right to work for sex workers. I propose that the central government should coordinate the establishment of the preparatory special zone if the local government is unwilling. In the form of a ""building"" (it can be a small park, such as 3 or 4 buildings) and operated by the ""government"", a special area for sex is set up, and sex work must be registered anonymously for management. In the form of a building, it is similar to a residence or a hotel. There are dozens of rooms of about 6.7 ping in the interior, which are rented by sex workers at a preferential price as a place for sex transactions. There should be a panic button in the room to prevent violence from happening. The so-called government operation means that the government builds the building (constructors can be entrusted, and the government has to collect tickets from consumers to subsidize the finances), manage and maintain it, assist sex workers to conduct regular health checkups, and send police to station when necessary. In fact, the sex trade is directly contacted by sex workers and clients, and the government does not intervene. And it can be restricted to engage in sex trade only by domestic sex workers, and it can only be consumed by national citizens. The government can also provide vocational training to help sex workers in need change careers.']"

The proliferation of drugs has caused many families to be destroyed and their wives to be separated. The proliferation of drugs has not only broken many families, but also increased the number of drug addicts. Drug addicts not only deteriorate their health after being exposed to drugs, but also have to accept criminal sanctions; drug dealers and drug transporters go to drug trafficking because they are not doing their jobs, which not only leads to a decline in the employment population, but also causes a major hazard to public security. Under the influence of many factors, there are often many negative impacts on the country, such as the decline of national productivity and competitiveness, the regression of economic development (eg: GDP), and the damage of our country's international image (sentenced for overseas drug trafficking), etc. If drugs are decriminalized, although the crime rate may drop, this is just an ostrich mentality, and there is no way to eradicate the drug problem. The drug problem is not only a national health problem, but also a national security problem. I suggest to the government that drug dealers and drug traffickers must not be forgiven, because they are like social parasites and have caused serious harm to the country in all aspects. According to the criminal responsibility of drug trafficking and transportation in our country, the criminal responsibility of the fourth-level drugs alone is too light!

Other methods prohibited by the announcement of the central competent authority.', 'Drunk driving is due to the prevalence of drinking alcohol and should be controlled at the sourceDrunk driving accidents are emerging one after another. Even with heavy penalties, there is still no improvement. Tragedy is repeated. There are social news about drunk driving accidents almost every day. 1. Now any company can import alcohol by applying for a ""tobacco and alcohol import business license"". No matter whether the alcohol sellers understand alcohol or not, whether they have an alcohol license or not, they are not sure about the quality. The habit of Chinese people drinking alcohol should be legislated to set the threshold for importing alcoholic beverages, and there should also be special supporting regulations for sales channels. 2. Why not increase the tobacco tax and tobacco donations? All alcoholic beverages, regardless of type, are taxed according to their alcohol concentration. The higher the alcohol concentration, the higher the tax, so as to increase the price to curb the willingness to drink or the amount of drinking. The increased tax can even be set up as a special account to compensate victims or be used as long-term care funds or public welfare purposes.', ""In response to the problem of drunk driving, start from the beginning, comprehensively introduce alcohol health donations, increase alcohol taxes, and comprehensively restrict alcohol advertising and sales in accordance with the Tobacco Hazard Prevention LawAt present, for the problem of drunk driving, heavier penalties are no longer enough to curb the occurrence of drunk driving. The government's indulgence, the court's light sentence, and the public's disregard have become a ticking time bomb on the road. In addition to the persecution in traffic, incidents of fights and injuries caused by drunkenness are also emerging in endlessly. The problem of drinking is not only a problem in traffic, but has also seriously affected the right to a stable life of ordinary people. Moreover, according to the latest medical research, alcohol has no harmful effects on health, and the body of Asians (Taiwanese) is far less able to break down alcohol than Europeans and Americans. In view of this, the government should comprehensively levy alcohol health donations, raise alcohol taxes, and restrict sales, promotions, and advertisements of alcohol products like tobacco products, and print pictures and warnings of traffic accidents, fights and injuries caused by drinking on alcohol packaging to alert people to drinking. In addition, the government has used a large number of police forces to carry out alcohol testing in order to prevent drunk driving, but the results have not been obvious. This not only increases the service burden of the police colleagues, but also wastes national resources. Tobacco and alcohol are of the same family, and the quantity is determined by price. Tobacco products are acceptable, and alcohol is also acceptable.""]"

The neighbors who burn incense and paper money are physically and mentally exhausted, unable to recover from illness, and the noise creates mental confusion. Reporting also has to worry about the intimidation of the palace and temple. Not disrespecting tradition, but sincerely hope to improve the quality of life. Temples worship gods but should not harass neighbors. Many reports have been intimidated by the temple, so I hope to start with the law. Prohibit burning incense in temples to create air pollution Prohibit temples from making noise', ""Taiwan's temple groups create public dangers, noise, social order, and traffic problems that harm the public and require strict enforcement by civil affairs unitsTaiwan's religious beliefs have always been dominated by temple culture, and it is more realistic to say that people who are keen to participate in temple activities don't care: farmers, teenagers, gangsters, or elderly people with less pious education. As a result, many, many problems have been created. Although in recent years, the boards of directors of many large temple groups with a long history in Taiwan have been aware of the public's perception and adopted: prohibiting the burning of fireworks and firecrackers, not making gongs and drums in residential areas or during people's rest time, reducing the amount of paper money burned, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Of the more than 20,000 palaces and temples in Taiwan, less than 20 palaces and temples have this kind of improvement in environmental protection, industrial safety awareness, and high-quality cultural literacy. In contrast to government units, this professional unit should belong to the Central Civil Affairs Department, local civil affairs bureaus, civil affairs divisions or civil affairs divisions, but law enforcement officers often fail to implement Taiwan's administrative orders and the safety of the people due to local people's sentiments, personal beliefs, and erroneous ideas. The palace temples in Yunlin County are the highest in Taiwan. There are ritual activities in urban areas or towns almost every week. Before each temple ceremony, there is nothing more than a practice of beating gongs and drums every night from 19 to 22 pm. Most of the palaces and temples are located in residential areas or school areas or hospitals, but this kind of loud behavior, petitions and reports only get 30 minutes of silence, and then continue the next day or when the police leave. In addition, once the ceremony is in progress, the heads of palaces and temples shuttle around the streets and alleys, setting off firecrackers, fireworks, loud music, and beating gongs and drums along the road. This kind of mobile terrorist group makes the people at home very evil. Sadly, the leaders of this activity are often local officials (for example: township mayors, mayors). Every temple has a management committee. We propose to require the civil affairs unit to make clear legislation and strictly enforce it. As long as there is a violation that hurts the people, this bad group should be educated and improved. If it is serious, please immediately request to disband and stop business (cut off water and electricity). We have always hoped that behaviors that harm others are not called democracy or freedom of belief. 2. The sound generated by the temple must be within the daily time (08:00-18:00) and must not exceed the decibels of the residential area environmental protection control. 3. The location of firecrackers and pyrotechnics must be applied for and the local fire department will check and confirm the correctness, and there must be relevant fire preparation procedures when releasing. 4. The detour route of palaces and temples must be carried out according to the application, the time must be punctual, and the public must be advised not to set off firecrackers and fireworks along the way. There must be safety traffic control and righteous traffic (legal traffic control) personnel participating in the intersection. 5. For those who participate in temple activities, the garbage and ashes should be cleaned up. Once reported, they will be fined and controlled. 6. It is strictly forbidden for people under the age of 18 to participate in the palace battle or lift the sedan chair...etc. 7. It is strictly forbidden to make any religious sounds at night or in the early morning (especially the use of electronic amplification equipment) in the temple located in the residential area. The Civil Affairs Bureau is requested to invite relevant local units to be responsible for the implementation. If the temple management committees or boards of directors violate the law and do not immediately improve it, in addition to the current laws and regulations, such as the Social Order Law, Public Danger, and Road Safety Law, they can also use tools to try to influence other people's beliefs and create religious opposition. At present, the biggest problem with temple rituals is that people sit and rest at night but are too noisy to eat or sleep outside, and are woken up at 05:30 early in the morning. Such rituals and behaviors are really not a blessing for the people. Examples: https://youtu.be/ijFREM96hCc https://youtu.be/NXPAzfro-ZM"", 'Issues such as noise caused by activities and ceremonies in Taiwan’s palaces and temples, public danger, obstruction of passers-by, damage to schools and hospitals, forced intrusion of religious beliefs, etc.There are more than 20,000 legally registered temples in Taiwan, which is one of the special religious beliefs in Taiwan. In recent years, due to the changes of the times, people live in groups, and thanks to the media and technology, the sound and light, the palaces and temples learn from each other and compare the factions, as well as some political figures, local forces and young people (eight generals) to join. Common people often suffered from the rituals performed by such palace and temple culture. Although it is said that it is only available on special festivals, according to statistics, in addition to the first and fifteenth day of each month, there are temples in general areas, except for the first and fifteenth day of each month, there are pilgrimage groups (exchanges between palaces and temples) and various celebrations of gods and gods. It seems that the management methods of palaces and temples in the Republic of China have not been revised and adjusted since the establishment of the Republic of China in 28 years. In addition, Article 13 of the Constitution stipulates that the people have freedom of religious belief, but the law enforcement units ignore that those who stay at home under this temple ceremony are forced to invade by this religious ceremony (religious ceremony, chanting, firecrackers, beating gongs and drums). The following is the evidence of persecution in palaces and temples encountered by the public at present: 1. On the first and fifteenth day of each month and special festivals, people are forced to listen to the religious preaching voice while living in their homes through the use of electronic speakers, keyboards and microphones. Suggestions: The time, volume and scope of the music should be regulated, and the residents, schools, and hospitals should not be affected. 2. Palace and temple activities occupy roads, such as: Taiwan provincial roads, county roads... Firecrackers and fireworks are set off along the roads, sometimes causing fires in residents\' homes. Regardless of whether the application is made or not, it is suggested that their behavior and the location of the firecrackers should be evaluated. 3. Residents and households near palaces and temples are often unable to enter and exit due to palace activities blocking traffic, and a large number of firecrackers and pyrotechnics are more likely to cause public dangers. In addition to being blocked from the only disaster relief channel, residents are also in danger of fire. Many cases of fires caused by palace and temple activities also often occur. Suggestion: legal palaces should provide perfect escape lanes and fire protection mechanisms to avoid regrettable accidents. 4. Some teenagers or troublemakers often participate in palace and temple activities and occupy the road. Passers-by will be scolded by ""commanders"" if they honk their horns when they pass by. single). 5. If there are so-called groups of eight generals in palace and temple activities, such as knife suicide, electronic music, etc., the suggestion should be: set up a restricted area, do not cause minors to see fear in their hearts, and do not allow minors to participate in this activity. 6. For all temple activities (firecrackers, fireworks, beating gongs and drums, chanting), and noise activities, the activity time should be clearly stipulated. Suggestion: It is strictly prohibited near hospitals and schools. At night: after 20:00 and before 08:00 in the morning, residents and other religious believers should be given a quiet environment without religious noise. 7. It is customary for some palaces and temples to start motors and beat gongs and drums to wake up residents at 06:00 on the first and fifteenth day of each month, and to use microphones and loudspeakers to chant scriptures in groups at night from 19 to 21, invading the households so that salaried students cannot have enough time to sleep and study quietly at home. Suggestion: Regardless of any religion, the sound should not invade other people\'s homes and the time should be clearly regulated, and there are penalties. 8. According to the Announcement No. 1013614184 of the Yunlin County Government, the sixth point of the third item of the announcement: the use of ritual instruments to engage in activities such as prayer and chanting, and temples or churches (church) established or registered in accordance with the law are not subject to this restriction. However, this law has been expanded and interpreted: as long as the palace and temple are legally registered, religious noises that invade residents can be generated at any time, and the use of electronic amplification equipment is also called: magic weapon. Suggestion: It should be reasonable, reasonable, and legal on the premise of not harming others and infringing on their religious beliefs (belief should not be loud and noisy, creating public danger, and harming others).']"

The construction skills and construction quality of the Highway Bureau are not consistent with the quality of outsourced repairs by the water and electricity units; forming the phenomenon of ""there is no three-mile level road"". In the past, the ""Luping Project"" was not implemented at all, and it was only a five-minute buzz. Even if it was paved on the same day, less than a month later, the water conservancy unit and Taipower unit deliberately raised the manhole cover on the road surface under excuses, and then handed over the road paving project to the private sector for rough construction, regardless of the quality of the road used by the people. Request the Executive Yuan to unify the ""review and rectification of all important roadbeds and manhole covers in Taiwan to reduce and move them to the center of non-roads"", return the quality of roads to the whole people, and establish relevant penalties! Hereby propose.', 'Improve the problem of uneven roads and too many manhole covers in TaiwanProposals: 1. Establish common underground pipelines. Reasons: Although the government passed the ""Common Pipeline Law"" in 2006, the implementation has not been effective. Telecommunications and other industries are unwilling to cooperate and build their own manhole covers, resulting in uneven road surfaces, which not only affect the appearance, but also affect the driving safety of riders. Method: Call on the government to truly implement the common pipeline law, and force operators to participate in the common pipeline excavation (of course, some preferential measures can be proposed), and if they refuse, the common pipeline law will prohibit them from digging on the common pipeline. If the operator attaches the cable to the sewer to circumvent the above-mentioned ban on excavation, he will be fined heavily. 2. Move the manhole cover to the sidewalk Reason: Same as the above reason, to ensure the safety of the rider. Method: After the excavation of the common pipeline, it is bound to reduce many manhole covers, and then move the manhole covers to the sidewalk, and the people can enjoy a smooth road. 3. Beautify manhole covers Reason: Manhole covers in Taiwan are square and round, but the stripes on them are super ugly! It simply affects the appearance of the city! Unlike sidewalk manhole covers in Europe, each city designs manhole covers in a pattern specific to that city. Method: After the implementation of 1 and 2, the local government will design the style of the city\'s manhole cover (the public can open the call for contributions) 4. Adopt the Japanese road paving technology. When making up, it is not like Japan will definitely compact it. Taiwan always repairs only a thin layer, and the materials used are not as good as those in Japan. After repairing, it needs to be maintained for more than 12 hours according to the regulations, but many of them are not strictly implemented... Method: Adopt Japanese road paving technology to repair the road. 5. Ordered by the central government Reason: For the same reason, although the common pipeline law was passed in 2006, local governments have not been able to implement it properly. Method: The central government plans a unified plan, and the renovation must be completed within 4 years after formulation, and then handed over to the local governments for implementation. If it is not completed, it will be held accountable accordingly.', 'Taiwan road construction1.

After the underground pipeline maintenance and other projects are completed, if the asphalt pavement is excavated, the entire section of the road within the excavation range must be re-paved, and road patching is rejected. 5. If only two-lane roads are excavated for the excavation of roads above 4 lines, the paving work must also extend to both sides to the double yellow line & the sideline of the road surface, rejecting the high and low tangent lines of the road surface. 6. The manhole cover must be at the same height as the road surface, not lower & higher than the road surface, and no asphalt coverage is allowed. 7. Taiwan’s road construction technology must be compared with that of Japan. If the completed road section is not as expected, the public can report it to the county and city governments, and the county and city governments will hold a referendum. If more than 1/2 of the turnout rate is negative, the contracting company will be fined and suspended for 3 months. The contractor will be replaced and the road will be rebuilt. 8.

The slow rise from 1999 to 2011 resulted in serious social opposition. The slow rise of oil prices in 1999 caused a lot of policy burdens, which caused CNPC to lose money. However, because the burden was deducted when calculating the company\'s performance, newspapers and magazines reported a large number of CNPC\'s serious losses and received high bonuses. As a result, the performance bonus of state-owned enterprises was deducted from 2.6 months to 2.4 months. As a result of the government intervening in the oil price for the second time, rumors that ""the international oil price was higher than it is now, but the domestic oil price is lower than it is now"" are still widely circulated by the public. It cannot be shown that the public doubts the fairness of the oil price formula, and it creates materials to attack the government and state-owned enterprises. This bitter fruit is still going on today. Directly halving the price of oil and increasing it is actually subsidizing large oil users and punishing people who save energy and fuel in disguise.

116,115,30,115_parking_spaces_heavy_parked,"['parking', 'spaces', 'heavy', 'parked', 'locomotives', 'large', 'locomotive', 'motorcycle', 'motorcycles', 'space']","[""Discussion on the opening of large and heavy locomotives to be parked in locomotive parking spacesAccording to the previous meeting of the Ministry of Communications and the reasons for the refusal, there are many misunderstandings in it. I hope to discuss the issue of large and heavy motorcycles being allowed to park in the motorcycle parking spaces. The relevant reasons are detailed as follows: 1. Because the regulations limit the parking spaces and the types of parking that can be parked, the local government cannot charge for large and heavy motorcycles parked in the motorcycle spaces. Even if the local government allows heavy motorcycles to be parked, the motorcycle charging system cannot input the heavy motorcycle number. I have confirmed with Taipei City Councilors that this part is the responsibility of the central government, and the local government cannot respond. 2. No matter where you want your car to park, no one wants to be fined for parking on a motorcycle grid. The penalty is to be regarded as a crime and disrupt social order, and such stigmatization has intensified the public's rejection of heavy machinery, and further actively reported the parking spaces of heavy machinery, so the number of reports has been increasing. Removing such stigmatization is a major focus of this proposed reform, and the increased number of reports also reflects a great urgency. 3. According to the marking and marking rules, the maximum size of the motorcycle parking grid is 1.5 meters wide and 2.5 meters long, which is the same size as the special grid designated by Taipei City. At the same time, according to the content of the report, 97.7% of the large and heavy locomotives are less than 2.5 meters in length, and most of them are compatible with the current locomotive grid designation rules. As long as the size of the motorcycle grid is drawn enough, the green, white, yellow and red plates can share the same parking grid. 4. Heavy-duty riders usually use other cars and motorcycles at the same time. One person can only ride one kind of car to go out at the same time. Compatible general-purpose cars can reduce the situation of crowding out parking spaces, but incompatible special-purpose cars will cause crowding of parking spaces. 5. On the same roadside, it is common to have a mix of parking spaces for cars and motorcycles, or even a mix of parking areas for buses. The usual width of the parking spaces for cars is about 2.2 to 2.3 meters, and the minimum width of the parking areas for buses is 3 meters. According to calculations, the length of the parking spaces for motorcycles in these places actually has a margin of more than 200 cm. 6. Because the heavy machine is heavy and the road surface is designed to be super high in the center for drainage, when parking vertically on the side of the road, it will park with the rear of the car facing the curb. When parking, slide in reverse along the direction of gravity, and accelerate to leave when leaving. It is relatively easy and simple. Moreover, this method is safer than the general way of rear-facing outwards because it can better confirm the main line of traffic when leaving. At the same time, this is also a commonly regulated way of parking two-wheelers internationally. 7. As early as 2015, the Taipei City Motorcycle Policy Workshop established a consensus to support the comprehensive charging of motorcycles under the premise of charging according to the area ratio, so there is no trouble that heavy machinery cannot be charged. And parking is an external cost issue, which should be charged according to the occupied road area, regardless of the type of vehicle."", 'The parking spaces for small cars should be designated in the same way as the parking spaces for large carsAccording to Article 92 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Penalties"", ""Large and heavy locomotives, unless otherwise specified in this regulation, shall be subject to the same driving and punishment regulations as small cars."" According to this article, the provisions of Article 190 of the ""Rules for Setting up Road Traffic Signs, Markings, and Marks"" are derived, and they are classified as ""small vehicles and large and heavy locomotives"" and ""locomotives other than large and heavy locomotives"", and different parking regulations apply respectively. According to the aforementioned regulations, large and heavy locomotives with small volume must be parked in the small car parking spaces according to the regulations when parking. However, the length and width of large heavy locomotives are only 2.5 meters and 0.8 meters, and they can only be parked in small car parking spaces with a length of 5.5 meters and a width of 2.5 meters. These regulations lead to the drivers of many small cars looking for parking spaces, but often find that the compartments are occupied by large heavy locomotives, causing mutual displeasure among drivers. Accordingly, the 2014 letter from the Ministry of Communications only pointed out that due to the small grids for motorcycles in some areas, large and heavy motorcycles tend to exceed the parking grids when parked, and collide with other moving vehicles and cause damage, so they should not be parked in motorcycle parking spaces. In the current regulations, the right of way of small cars is almost the same as that of large cars. Therefore, it should be compared with the reasons for parking small cars with large and heavy locomotives, and the relevant regulations should be revised so that the parking spaces for small cars with the same right of way as large cars should also be designated according to the parking spaces for large cars.', 'The parking spaces for small cars should be designated in the same way as the parking spaces for large carsAccording to Article 92 of the ""Regulations on Road Traffic Management Penalties"", ""Large and heavy locomotives, unless otherwise specified in this regulation, shall be subject to the same driving and punishment regulations as small cars.""

We should consider changing the color and font of the passport cover. Many countries (such as New Zealand, the Philippines, Brazil, etc.) have changed the color of the passport cover, so it should not be the main reason for denying the replacement of the Republic of China (Taiwan) passport because they are worried that the customs agencies of various countries will not be able to recognize our passports. I think Chinese passports should use the same red cover and gold-inlaid fonts as Japanese ordinary adult passports, and at the same time improve the paper quality of the inner pages of the passport. Because countries such as Europe, Japan, and even China use red cover passports as their ordinary passports, I propose that the cover of ordinary passports in our country should also be changed to red. Since a passport is a certificate issued by a country to its citizens, it is an important document that must be taken when going abroad. Therefore, the first impression of the passport cover is very important, and the paper texture of the inside page of the passport is also the same. Our country's cultural creativity is very strong. In fact, it can be used in the design of passports. From a small place, we can see the progress of the country. (Swiss and Norwegian passports are very beautiful) Although many countries use red as the cover color of ordinary passports, there is a big difference in the red they choose. We can use Japanese passports as samples to improve the quality of ROC passports. Although China also uses red passports, ordinary Chinese passports are dark red and purple, which is very different from ordinary adult passports in Japan. In this way, it can be highlighted that the two sides of the strait are not one country, we are a sovereign and independent political system, we are on an equal footing with Tokyo and Beijing, and we should consider adopting the same red color as Japanese passports. The SAR passport of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is the same green color as the current ordinary passport of the Republic of China. The CCP’s intentions are obvious. In order to make Taiwan another special zone of China and implement a two-system system, they have tried their best to make Taiwan a special zone of theirs. Therefore, they have adopted a green cover for the passports of the Macau Special Administrative Region, which is similar to the passports of Taiwan. This will easily confuse foreigners and identify Taiwan as another special zone of China."", 'The English on the passport only writes Taiwan, remove the Republic of China, so as not to be mistaken for Chinese by other countriesThe Republic of China (Republic of China) passport has caused Taiwanese people to be mistaken for Chinese in countries around the world. It has been a problem for many years. Recently, in response to the Wuhan pneumonia epidemic prevention policy in the world, this problem has been highlighted again. Some countries, such as Vietnam and Italy, regard Taiwan as an administrative region of China because of the CHINA on the passport, resulting in damage to the rights and interests of Taiwanese. Scholar Li Xiaofeng came out a few days ago to call for the revision of the name of the passport. Today (2/13) Yongshe held a press conference to ask the Legislative Yuan to revise the passport regulations, so that citizens can freely choose the country name of the Republic of China (Republic of China) or Taiwan (TAIWAN) on the cover page and data page of the passport. Faced with the restrictions and measures imposed on China by countries around the world, Taiwan has the right to make its own choices in various difficult situations. We hope that the government can hear the voice of the people and modify the English words ""Republic of China"" on the cover of the passport without involving complicated constitutional projects, or let the people of Taiwan choose the name of the foreign representative on the passport.']"

In addition, those who can empty out a lot of money are not ordinary people (of course, small people are also welcome, after all, the treasury has no money, and the prison is too crowded!), so they can also use 50 to 1000 times the amount of stolen money to redeem themselves. If there is an informant (the tainted witness is also acceptable, the premise is that he surrendered himself, not confessed only after being arrested). The sender of this move can get 10% of the amount as a reward for reporting. This move provides an incentive for criminal groups to turn back, and it can also greatly increase the difficulty of hollowing out companies. Of course, the condition for redemption is that the victim can only apply after receiving compensation.

However, the creation of the picture is protected by the constitutional freedom of the press. And there is no research pointing out that comics or other similar forms of media, pornography of underage characters that are not real human beings will cause social chaos, and there is no problem with increasing the crime rate.

According to Interpretation No. 455 of the Council of Justices, ""...Article 20 of the Constitution stipulates that the people have the obligation to perform military service in accordance with the law. The length of service between compulsory servicemen and voluntary servicemen may be related to professional knowledge, but the duty of loyalty and the service they perform during the service period are no different from those of voluntary servicemen. Soldiers shall enjoy the rights and interests calculated according to the number of years of service in accordance with the law. It should not be different depending on whether the service is compulsory service or voluntary service."" It is determined that it is equivalent to the service period of compulsory service, and it is also specifically mentioned that the duty of loyalty and service during the service period are no different from that of volunteer soldiers. Soldiers should enjoy the rights and interests of service seniority calculation according to law. It is suggested that the Ministry of National Defense should clearly stipulate in the ""Regulations on the Service of Non-commissioned Officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force"" that the years of military school are regarded as the years of active service, and can be counted in 20 years to receive the eligibility for lifetime pay. The biggest difference between the seniority of military school and the seniority of childcare retention is that during the military academy, if a war breaks out, military cadets are still obliged to serve as reservists on the battlefield. During the school period, they are also subject to militarized management. There is no fact of actual service in the post of childcare retention. Therefore, the regulations specifically stipulate that 20 years of life pay cannot be combined. According to the provisions of the current regulations, there is no special restriction on the eligibility of military school seniority not to be combined with 20 years of active service. Therefore, the combined years of military school seniority is interpreted as the restriction that the actual service period of 20 years can be used to receive lifetime pay, but the biggest misunderstanding is that the military school seniority is also the actual service period, but there is no official position, just like the compulsory service period. The first controversy is to let the military academy seniority be fully returned to the officers and soldiers and count the active service seniority of 20 years to receive the qualification for lifetime pension, which is the real care for the grassroots officers and soldiers.', 'Seniority in military academy shall not be counted into active service seniority and receiving pension is an administrative discretion that is illegalThe Ministry of National Defense issued a press release on July 20, 2017, stating that this annuity reform is to encourage active service personnel to stay for a long time.

""The five-year global average temperature from 2015 to 2019 has set a new high record since human beings recorded."" According to the climate research data of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), ""the carbon emissions in the past five years have increased by 20% compared with the previous five years (2011 to 2015)."" The World Meteorological Organization has nearly five years of climate reports compiled by climate scientists ahead of the United Nations General Assembly\'s Climate Action Summit. The article pointed out that the global average temperature in the past five years has risen by 1.1 degrees compared with the industrial era, and the temperature has increased by 0.2 degrees compared with the previous five years. The key is that sea level rise, glaciers melting, extreme weather and other phenomena are becoming more and more serious, which may make the past five years the highest temperature in history. Among them, the situation of sea level rise is the most serious, from a height of 3.2 mm per year in the past to a continuous rise of 5 mm per year now. The World Meteorological Organization is concerned that the sudden disappearance of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will inevitably exacerbate sea level rise. ▲ Global warming has intensified, resulting in rising sea levels, melting glaciers and extreme weather. (Source: pixabay) According to Agence France-Presse, Guterres believes that countries will gradually lose their advantage in this climate change race. This report highlights the widening gap between human actions and the speed of warming. The United Nations Climate Action Summit is here to discuss and commit to the aspirational goals of the Paris Agreement, including the need to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 in order to meet the global warming goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The meeting invited more than 60 heads of state to speak. According to the Financial Times, countries that continue to build coal-fired power generation are not on the invitation list, such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia. The United States, which withdrew from the agreement in 2017, and Brazil, which has recently attracted international attention, are also not on the invitation list due to the Amazon rainforest fire. In the early morning of the 24th, Guterres stated that 66 countries, 10 regions, 102 cities, 93 companies and 12 investors have committed to achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The whole world is paying attention to how much influence this year\'s climate action conference will exert in various countries. However, when countries that do not agree with the ""Paris Agreement"" and continue to build coal-fired power plants will be willing to do their part for the earth is probably the biggest key to stopping the global average temperature from hitting new highs. Taiwan will not be spared. In 2050, five Taipei cities will be flooded. In the face of climate warming and rising sea levels, Taiwan, which is surrounded by sea on all sides, may not be able to stay out of it. Last week, Greenpeace released the latest temperature, sea level, and potential future threat forecasts for various counties and cities, and named the southwestern coast as the first to suffer. If the increase in temperature does not improve, it is estimated that Taiwan\'s temperature will exceed 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. Although there is no future forecast for the sea level, based on the experience of the past 20 years, it has been rising at a rate of 3.4 millimeters per year, and the global rise is predicted to be 0.63 meters by the end of this century. How will the people of Taiwan be spared? Greenpeace adopts the 5th assessment report of the IPCC of the United Nations Climate Change Panel, and uses the 4 major scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and selects the more optimistic RCP2.6 and the most pessimistic RCP8.5 as the two measurement estimates. ▲ Greenpeace pointed out that in the face of climate warming and sea level rise, in Taiwan in 2050, many areas will become severely flooded. The former is a more optimistic view of the growth of greenhouse gas reduction in various countries, which belongs to the scenario of slowing down global warming; the latter is the most pessimistic view of the scenario of no emission reduction in each country, which is also a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions. According to the worst emission reduction scenario RCP8.5, the flooded area of \u200b\u200bTaiwan’s main island will reach 1,398.11 square kilometers in 2050, accounting for about 4% of the island’s area, which is about 5.14 times the size of Taipei City (about 271.8 square kilometers). The number of people affected is about 1.2 million, accounting for about 5% of the overall population. Greenpeace pointed out that the areas most affected by flooding are in the southwestern coast of Taiwan. The top three counties and cities are Tainan City (310.98 square kilometers), Yunlin County (249.97 square kilometers) and Changhua County (225.71 square kilometers). More than 170,000 people will be affected in Tainan, the most serious area. If Taiwan actively reduces carbon emissions, Greenpeace believes that the flooded area under the RCP2.6 scenario will be reduced to 271 square kilometers, and the affected population will be reduced to 300,000 people. Looking further at the ""warming"" scenario that is hotly discussed in the world, Greenpeace analyzed that if the temperature rises by 1.5 degrees, it will affect about 1.1721 million people in Taiwan. If the temperature rises by 4 degrees, 3.9125 million people will be affected. This is a 2.33% increase in the scope of impact compared to the 1.5-degree scenario, and the area of \u200b\u200bland damage will expand from the original 1331.05 square kilometers to 3359.96 square kilometers. Regardless of the global warming scenario, the southwestern coast of Taiwan will be the first to suffer the impact. What mankind is facing is no longer just climate change. What is more serious is that the climate crisis (Climate Crisis) is devouring the survival of human beings, and even endangering the survival rights of future generations.', 'In response to extreme weather, schools at all levels below senior high school should suspend outdoor assemblies and outdoor sports activities during extreme heatUnder global warming and extreme climate, it is not surprising that there are extremely high temperatures in summer. According to the Central Meteorological Administration, on July 24 this year (2020), the Taipei station observed a record high temperature of 39.7 degrees, and on July 19 and June 29, the Taipei station also observed high temperatures of 39 degrees and 38.9 degrees, respectively. If we observe the ""long-term trend of temperature at seven stations"" published by the Central Meteorological Bureau on its website, we can find that the average annual temperature of these seven stations is showing an upward trend, and the rate of increase is getting bigger and bigger. In the ""long-term trend of average temperature at 13 flat stations in Taiwan"", last year (2019) was even the hottest year since 1951. It can be seen that the temperature in summer will only get higher and higher in the future, and there will only be more and more extreme high temperatures. It is very uncomfortable and burdensome for ordinary adults to hold gatherings that require standing for a long time in the high temperature outdoors, or engage in sports activities that require a lot of physical strength, let alone high school, junior high school students, or even young elementary school students? For example, during the opening ceremony of our school this semester, the sun was shining brightly, and about 2,000 people crowded into the small playground to stand and listen to the lecture. In less than ten minutes, everyone was already sweating profusely. About half an hour later, a classmate in the next class collapsed in front of me due to exhaustion. Fortunately, a teacher caught him from behind quickly. In our class, a classmate was also dizzy from heat and was helped to rest under the shadow of the stairs. The two physical education classes of our class a week happened to be after noon. After a morning of exposure, the floor was already hot. The afternoon sun will not only cause heat damage, strong ultraviolet rays can not be ignored. Based on the above, I make the following suggestions: 1. When the Meteorological Bureau issues an orange light signal for high temperature information, schools at all levels below the junior high school level in the issuing area should suspend outdoor assemblies and outdoor sports activities; when the Meteorological Bureau issues a red light signal for high temperature information, schools at all levels below high school levels in the area should suspend outdoor assembly and outdoor sports activities. The information orange light signal advises the public to ""avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, labor and sports""; when the ""temperature reaches above 38 degrees Celsius and lasts for more than 3 days"", the Central Meteorological Administration will issue a high temperature information red light signal, suggesting ""avoid outdoor activities"" and ""outdoor work and exercise, stay away from high temperature environments"". I think that using the government\'s high temperature signal as the standard of ""high temperature"" and suspending outdoor activities based on the recommendations given by the high temperature signal can be objective, clearly defined, and feasible. 2. It should be regulated that schools at all levels below high school should avoid arranging outdoor courses such as physical education from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm in summer (June-September) Explanation: 11:00 am to 2:00 pm is mostly the hottest time of the day, and should be regulated during this period of summer to avoid arranging outdoor courses such as physical education to prevent school children from being injured by heat.

At the beginning of 2016, the people of Taiwan made a new choice to eliminate the old Congress, and the largest number of young people aged 20 to 29 voted in history.

The use of after-school tests also violates the right of students to leave classes on time and takes away from students\' time arrangements after school. Some schools also use class meetings to conduct exams, shortening the time of class meetings to cope with it, seriously violating the purpose of class meetings for cultivating students\' education in democracy and the rule of law. Teachers should use the above-mentioned time to take the exam only when there is ""unavoidable"" situation, instead of blindly handing out the exam papers to students and asking students to find time for the exam by themselves.', 'It is required that high school vocational schools should not arrange morning exams for early self-studyNowadays, most vocational schools in senior high schools are some distance away from the students\' homes. To get to school before being late, you must get up early. According to point 7 of the ""Twelve-year National Basic Education Curriculum Outline"" promulgated by the Ministry of Education in November 2013, ""Relevant students\' school work and rest and various non-study period activities shall be arranged by each school in accordance with the relevant regulations on the school work and rest time of senior high schools, junior high schools, and elementary school students stipulated by the competent authorities."" Early students often need to get up early to catch up with exams. The original intention of early self-study is to allow students to properly arrange their own learning activities in a flexible time, and should not arrange too many exams that need to be scored. So I think early self-study should not be arranged for scoring exams.', 'Adjust the school time, delete the content of the syllabus, and change the tutoring class to apply for the establishmentFirst explain the appeal: 1. Change the school time to 9:00~17:00 2. Delete the content of the curriculum 3. Change the tutoring class (section 8) to apply for establishment. This is a coherent change. Reducing any one will reduce the remaining benefits or waste the previous efforts. In the middle and high schools, there are often the phenomenon of taking exams and classes in morning self-study and tutoring classes (section 8). However, according to regulations, morning self-study exams should not be included in the calculation of academic performance evaluation, and the course content should not be taught in advance in tutoring classes. However, the above phenomena abound. After searching a lot of news, the Ministry of Education has also listed it as one of the ""normalization of teaching"". From non-governmental organizations and the news, it is found that one of the main reasons for the above phenomenon is ""classes cannot be finished, and we must catch up with the schedule."" In fact, the arrangement of the syllabus is based on the standard of 7 classes, which means that these courses should be taught within 7 classes. The many illegal problems do not mean that there is a problem with the teacher\'s teaching method. Referring to the teaching progress of foreign countries, we can find that the class content in Taiwan is too many and complicated. It is hoped that by reducing the syllabus content, the school will avoid the eighth class, self-study and illegal exams and classes. Firstly, the content of the syllabus is reduced so that teachers can really finish teaching within 7 classes. Then, the tutoring class is changed to an application system. In fact, not so many students want or need to participate in the tutoring class. Recently, some high schools have also tried to reduce or cancel the eighth class. However, schools considering special needs and lack of educational resources can still offer applications. Finally, the three purposes of adjusting the school time are explained. 1. To prevent the school from setting up remedial classes under other names: At present, the proportion of violations in Section 8 is very high according to the statistics, but students do not understand and dare not take the initiative to report, and supervisors and other supervisors cannot tell whether the class is reviewing the progress or the course content. If there is no problem with the current supervision mechanism, there will not be such a high proportion of violations now. 2. Reduce the impact of system changes: students and their parents have become accustomed to the current life style, and avoid the gaps between going home after school and tutoring. 3. Increase the sleep time of students: According to relevant medical research, the sleep mechanism of teenagers is to go to bed late and wake up late. This is a physiological problem and it is difficult to change. In addition, sufficient sleep is more efficient than long-term class hours, and insufficient sleep will also affect health. Reference materials: 1. The Ministry of Education’s instructions on tutoring courses. 2. Illegal class supplementary submissions and comments 1, illegal course supplementary submissions and comments 2, illegal course supplementary submissions and comments 3, tutoring willingness forms only have ""participation"" or ""agree"", sleep and tutoring surveys in junior high schools. 3. Consensus of experts from the National Sleep Foundation of the United States, teenagers tend to go to bed late and wake up late, and teenagers tend to go to bed late and wake up late 2, the benefits of delaying school, Singapore studies increase the time in bed for students who delay school']"

Decades of priority construction areas have no objective and reasonable standards, passiveness, injustice, and injustice. What are the rights and interests of consumers, users, and residents? With huge resources and a high proportion of pan-government shares, it has been unwilling to make drastic changes to promote construction innovation and balance regional development. 5G is about to appear, and the full digitalization of TV has also reached its goal. It is still under development and construction. It only takes a few months for the cable TV industry to completely replace the cable equipment inside and outside the house and replace the connectors with new ones. The highest speed currently available for installation is ADSL 640K/8M. In a situation where everyone, regardless of age, uses Internet TV, computers, smart phones, tablets, monitors, etc., network technology is not enough. use. Chunghwa Telecom often uses the right-of-way excavation problem to respond to the vast number of users who have not been able to upgrade to the optical fiber network for more than 10 years, and there are no reasonable standards for its planning and construction. It can also be used to fool kind-hearted residents with millions of users, check the network-based excavation system of their right-of-way unit, and even point out that there is no application for the right-of-way unit, and they point out that excavation and construction cannot be done if there is a right-of-way, and most of the last mile is underground. Chunghwa Telecom has been offering a hidden version of fiber-optic speed-up discounts. ADSL users’ copper cable connection quality is unstable and interferes with maintenance. The speed is dozens of times slower and more expensive than fiber-optic users. In addition, it uses 15% discount for old ADSL customers and installation fees for installation and refund procedures. Being slaughtered (20% of the announced data but more than 1 million ADSL users), we have to wait for other priority areas to have fiber optics and upgrade high-speed networks 10 years ago to build FTTH and enable them to enjoy more competitive preferential prices. The regional operation offices of Chunghwa Telecom evade the announcement of tariff plans in various ways, such as marketing the hidden version of the HiNet project discount contract (ADSL 8M/640K bundled for 3 years at 539 yuan, and Guangshidai 16M/3M 429 yuan, etc.), several hidden contract plans in various regions, are they suspected of violating the first category of telecommunications business tariff management measures and telecommunications law and other relevant regulations, and the promotional tariff plan has not been reported to the NCC for approval and announcement?

However, there are various reasons that we have no way to control people who do not have a driver's license to drive a vehicle. If it can stop unlicensed people from driving, then unlicensed teenagers and people who have had their driver's license revoked for drunk driving will not be able to drive and cause accidents. I have such an idea: to change the existing paper driver's license into a smart card for electronic driver's license. In addition to the car key, all vehicles must have an electronic driver's license to start. This will not only prevent unlicensed driving, but also those who have been suspended for drunk driving and have their driver's license revoked will not be able to drive to reduce the recidivism rate to zero."", ""The liability for driving without a license is 100%, not just a fineMany traffic violations and drunk driving are suspended, driving the vehicle after the driver's license is revoked, or driving the vehicle under the age of obtaining the driver's license. In the event of a car accident, the traffic police only issue a ticket for unlicensed driving and clarify the responsibility. I think this is a violation of the regulations that require a driver's license to drive a vehicle. Several of my friends have been hit by an unlicensed student riding a motorcycle. The police issued an unlicensed driving ticket to the student. The subsequent liability is judged according to the proportion of the accident at the scene. We all think it is very unreasonable. Isn’t it absolutely forbidden to drive a vehicle on the road without a driver’s license? It should be 100% responsible for the accident. Why is it judged that the friend is also at fault? Is this to encourage people who have money to pay the fines not to obey the law? The government enacted this regulation just to earn a fine? ? It is expected that by modifying the cognitive judgment of its police officers in law enforcement"", ""Unlicensed driving should bear the responsibilityThe current penalties for unlicensed driving can’t deter people from driving without a license at all. The average people go out and drive so many times, and they are asked to show their driver’s license in less than 1% of cases (not counting accidents). That is to say, if you are caught driving without a license without encountering an accident, you can buy a lottery. (The premise is that you look like an adult.) In the past, people without a license would not ride their car on other people's faces all day long, so it doesn't matter, but the times have changed. In this era of unlicensed accident rates, I personally feel that the risk of driving without a license should be increased to ensure the safety of road users who abide by the law. However, because the current system and police force cannot take care of it at all, but in fact there is no need to restrict those unlicensed drivers who drive safely (improper driving without a license, it is okay to have a license or not), so the current law will presuppose that there is a cause, and it has been proved that unlicensed driving can be counted as a cause. However, in this era of non-improving car performance (compared to the era of enacting laws), when an accident occurs, either nothing happens or death or injury, it is necessary to increase the proportion of unlicensed driving as a cause and liability, so that the license examination and license suspension system is meaningful. Example 1: If the two parties have 50%of their responsibilities each, there should be some more responsibilities for one party, and it will become 64 or 73 examples. 2: There is no compilation of 30%, and 70%of the compilation of the other side, the unchanged example 3: 70%of the side of the party, 30%of the compilation of the party, then the proportion of the above proportion of the above is 82 or 91. The reason is free to drive at will (even if it is three treasures). PS. A good road environment cannot be achieved because of a change or increase or decrease of a law. Please work hard together, thank you.""]"

This provision was specially revised in 1966 to encourage academic works and promote cultural development; after 71 years of the Republic of China, it was revised to be tax-exempt for those with a total amount of less than 60,000 yuan per year; to the 78th year of the Republic of China, in order to comply with the change of currency unit stipulated in Article 6 of the Income Tax Law, it was revised to be tax-free with a total annual quota of 180,000 yuan or less. The tax exemption amount of this clause has not been adjusted for 30 years. Comparing with the 1978 Income Tax Law of the same period, the special deduction amount for salary income was 45,000 yuan per person per year; and the current income tax law of 1998, the special salary income deduction amount has been increased to 200,000 yuan per person per year. This is because Article 5-1 of the Income Tax Law applies to the adjustment of the special deduction for salary income, and the provisions of Article 5 of the Income Tax Law apply mutatis mutandis. Whenever the consumer price index rises by more than 3% from the index in the previous adjustment year, it shall be adjusted according to the degree of increase. The special deduction for salary income has been adjusted from 45,000 yuan per person per year in 1978 to the current 200,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 4.5 times. From the adjustment regulations, it can be seen that the price increase in the past 30 years has been astonishing.

This clause was specially updated in 1966 to encourage academic works and promote cultural development. However, since the revision of this clause in 1978, the fixed tax exemption amount of this clause has not been adjusted for 30 years. Compared with the special deduction amount for salary income in the past 30 years, it has been raised from 45,000 yuan per person per year in 1978 to 200,000 yuan per person per year under the current income tax law. This is because the adjustment of the special deduction for salary income shall be subject to the provisions of Article 5-1 of the Income Tax Law. Whenever the consumer price index rises by more than 3% compared with the index of the previous adjustment year, it shall be adjusted according to the degree of increase. It can be seen that the special deduction for salary income has increased by nearly 4.5 times in 30 years, reflecting the astonishing increase in prices in the past 30 years. Compared with this price increase, the fixed tax exemption of 180,000 yuan established 30 years ago seems like a drop in the bucket today.

It is suggested that Article 8-5 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law include the criteria for the determination of income from manuscript fees and other income into electronic media. As mentioned in the previous item, in the era of the decline of paper and the rise of digital, many relevant practitioners have to turn to electronic (network) media to publish their works; however, the criteria for the determination of income from manuscript fees and other income in Article 8-5 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law are still limited to traditional print media such as publishing or newspapers and magazines, which is outdated and insufficient. It is hoped that the government can amend this law or add relevant regulations to expand the scope of application.']"

The Ministry of Health and Welfare should protect the health of the people and the rights of consumers to know and be healthy. Government agencies should first require chain beverage brands to label the sugar content of each cup to provide consumers with a unified standard for choice. For example, the 3-point sugar in the store is marked as the sugar content in grams or the number of sugar cubes, and the label or clear annotation allows consumers to make a clear choice, so that consumers can self-assess the daily sugar intake when drinking beverages. The goal should finally be extended to non-chain beverage brands. After the sugar content standard is unified, consumers can take their own health as the first check, so that consumers have the right to consume knowledge. Indicate the sugar content of beverages. So that consumers have a unified standard, can know their own sugar intake and check their own health.

Unreasonable speed limit Everyone who reads the news knows that it is very common to see people speeding at every turn, but... are they really driving fast? ? On a wide and straight road, if you drive at a speed of 40 kilometers per hour, you will feel that you are actually walking very slowly, and you will start to increase your speed and cause speeding. Therefore, you should refer to the ""Eighty-five Percentile Speed"". Another example is the expressway. Many road sections can drive up to 100 kilometers, but the speed limit is only 90 kilometers. Therefore, I advocate that the Eighty-five Percentile Speed \u200b\u200bshould be used to set the speed limit on all road sections (including expressways), instead of setting it randomly to make the speed limit reasonable. The best way is to reduce the width of the road and make the road narrower, so that pedestrians can be slowed down in a physical way, or speed bumps can be set up, etc... These are physical ways to slow down pedestrians, so there is room to add physical sidewalks, bicycle lanes, etc. So I advocate a comprehensive re-examination of those unreasonable road planning. In some places, you can drive up to 60 kilometers without being photographed. Passersby who obediently abide by the speed limit will be forced to give way by those who exceed the speed limit by honking their horns or maliciously flashing lights. Another example is that the speed limit in an alley is usually 20 or 30 kilometers, but passers-by generally feel that there is a 10-kilometer limit, so they will drive at a speed as high as 30 or 40 kilometers per hour. Therefore, I advocate canceling the 10-kilometer limit value of the speed camera. The maximum speed is the same as the speed limit.', 'Draw more speed limit markings and adjust the speed limit to improve efficiencyPeople often don’t know what the speed limit is when driving or cycling on roads they are not very familiar with. When encountering “speed camera in front”, they may not notice the sign, or the sign may be broken (I don’t know if it was caused by a typhoon or was hit by a car), or the sign is blocked by debris, or there are too many things on the roadside to notice, so they just let the speed camera take a photo. There are many roads that are obviously majestic avenues, with more than two lines on one side, and the turning range is similar to that of national highways, but there are no intersections or residents around, and the speed limit is only 50 or 60. Suggestions: 1. No matter what the original road speed limit is, evaluate and adjust the speed limit of the road section, so that the section that does not need to be slow can be accelerated, and the section where the speed limit is still too high can be slowed down, and the efficiency can be improved within a safe range. 2. All roads encountering the boundary (location) of the speed limit change must have speed line signs and markings, and at the same time use the signs and markings to announce the upcoming change 100 meters before the speed limit change, so as to prevent everyone from rushing to stop and causing accidents. 3. On general roads, the speed limit is marked on the ground every 1-2 kilometers, and the speed limit is marked on the important intersection after passing the intersection, so as not to have the feeling of ""what is the speed limit after walking for so long?"" 4. All roads with direct right-turn lanes (turning right without stopping at a red light) are considered important intersections, and the speed limit should be marked on the ground. 5. When the locomotive encounters an interchange, viaduct or other specific areas, it must detour to the side road and must mark the speed limit. 6. All ramps are connected to general roads, regardless of the size of the road, the speed limit must be marked, and each ramp must indicate whether the speed limit of the ramp is 40 or 50. 7. All fixed speed cameras must be marked with a speed limit 100 meters before the location. 8. Every time an expressway or expressway passes through an interchange, the maximum speed limit is marked on each lane (generally the minimum is 60, which can be considered or not). 9. In items 2 to 8, the original speed limit signs and markings do not need to be marked again. 10. No minimum speed limit is considered. From one road section to another, when the speed limit difference is too large, the speed limit can be increased one or more times, but the speed limit can be changed to gradually decrease, and the speed is reduced by 5 kilometers per hour every few hundred meters. 11. All speed limit signs should be set up in obvious places and cannot block road signs or other markers. 12. For the signs and markings set up during construction, the signs and markings shall be removed immediately after the construction is completed, and the markings shall be completely obliterated or the road sections shall be resurfaced, so as not to be confused with ordinary road signs and markings. 13. The speed limit of the construction section can be adjusted, and it is not necessary to uniformly adopt a speed of 30 per hour.', '[Effectively reduce traffic accident rate] It is recommended that highways, expressways, and tunnels gradually implement interval speed measurement instead of fixed-point speed measurementExpressways, expressways, and tunnels all have their own safe speed limits. When the speed exceeds the speed limit, it is easy to cause loss of life and property to others and oneself. Therefore, the government sets up speed cameras and bans violating drivers to ensure the safety of other road users. The current way to ban speeding is to use fixed-point speed measurement, which means that a speed camera is set up somewhere. When the speed of the vehicle passes the speed camera and exceeds the speed limit, a speeding ticket will be received. But now that technology is advanced, when drivers know the location of each speed camera through mobile apps, navigators or driving recorders, drivers will start to opportunistically, and speed cameras will gradually lose their function: banning violating drivers. Why does it gradually lose its function? An example is as follows: the speed limit of the expressway is 100 kilometers, and a driver drives at a speed of 150 kilometers per hour. When approaching the speed camera, the driving recorder sounds ""There is a speed camera ahead."" The driver must immediately step on the brakes to reduce the speed to about 100 kilometers. In this way, the speed camera loses its function. This kind of driving is very dangerous. When the car brakes suddenly, the vehicles behind may not be able to react in time and cause casualties such as collisions. This kind of driver who endangers the safety of others has escaped the law, and there is no way to prosecute him in the current way. Therefore, I suggest gradually implementing interval speed measurement instead of fixed-point speed measurement on important roads such as expressways, expressways, and tunnels. What is interval speed measurement: interval speed measurement refers to the arrangement of two speed measurement points on the same road section, and calculates the average driving speed of the vehicle on the road section by measuring the time before and after the vehicle passes through the two speed measurement points, and judges whether the vehicle is speeding according to the speed limit standard on the road section, which will be more scientific and fair. For example, the distance between two speed measuring points on a certain highway section is 100 kilometers, and the speed limit on this section is 100 kilometers per hour. If the car takes more than one hour to complete the run, its average speed will be lower than 100 kilometers per hour. Taking the above example, a driver has been driving at a speed of 150 kilometers per hour. It is useless to slow down suddenly after taking a speed test camera. In the end, the average speed may be more than 140 kilometers per hour, and he will be sanctioned.']"

According to the results of 1/16 legislative elections, only five political parties have reached the 3.5% subsidy threshold for political parties, including the KMT and the DPP. After receiving a huge subsidy for four years, it is very detrimental for the survival of the small party to have no subsidy due to the threshold of votes after the small party enters the election. This subsidy regulation indirectly limits the participation opportunities of the small party and becomes a subsidy tool for the big party. Therefore, judging from the results of the 1/16 legislative election results, it is more reasonable that the subsidy threshold for political parties should be lowered from the current 3.5% to 2%. The upper limit, taking into account the actual proportion of votes won by the two major parties in previous legislative elections, the upper limit threshold should be set at 10%, so as not to affect the slightly larger small party.', 'The political party law subsidy threshold is lowered, and the amount of subsidy should be cappedSince political party subsidies are the source of funds for political party operations in democratic countries, maintaining the basic financial resources of political parties is very important in order to improve the development of political parties, implement party politics, promote democratic competition, and reduce political parties’ excessive reliance on donations, corruption or collusion between government and business. Therefore, the government has established political party subsidy funds to help political parties develop. However, the current threshold for political party subsidy funds is too high (3%). Only 24 votes are required to receive subsidy funds. As a result, only six political parties can receive subsidy funds in the 2020 election. However, because there is no upper limit, the total subsidy funds are 659 million per year. The two major parties refer to the Chinese Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party. Foreign cases: Japan has 2% or 5 seats of parliamentarians, with a subsidy of 250 yen per vote;', 'Political party subsidies lower the threshold and set the ceilingSince political party subsidies are the source of funds for the operation of political parties in democratic countries, maintaining the basic financial resources of political parties is very important in order to improve the development of political parties, implement party politics, promote democratic competition, and reduce excessive reliance on donations, corruption or collusion between political parties and businessmen.

In addition to controlling intersection signals, sound and light warning systems ""as dense as street lights"" should be installed on all public roads in Taiwan (including township roads, county roads, provincial roads, expressways, national roads, etc., and other public roads). In the section where the police are on duty, the sound and light warnings will be used in advance to inform passers-by to yield to the vehicles of the ambulance units, and the roads will be cleared to facilitate the smooth operation of the ambulance units. Addendum to the Green Wave Safety System for Police, Fire and Ambulance: If this case is passed and implemented smoothly, in view of Article 2 of the above main article, in order to maintain the safety of police and firefighters and make it more secure, it is recommended that the Executive Yuan, together with the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, discuss the establishment and amendment of relevant laws and regulations. 2. In order to reduce the pressure of the police, firefighters and ambulances on duty, a separate ambulance exemption should be established. The content is: when the police, firefighters, and ambulances are on duty, when public affairs and other necessary emergency factors cause financial damage to the public, the personnel of the police, firefighters, and ambulance units are completely exempt from responsibility; if the police, firefighters, and ambulance personnel or equipment are damaged due to failure to comply with the relevant laws on ambulance and failure to comply with Appendix 1, they can be compensated and punished. 3. In order to avoid disturbing residents, the sound and light warning system should only have light and shadow effects from 23:00 in the middle of the night to 06:00 in the morning. The establishment of the pilot mobile ambulance team In response to the critical situation of human life, it is recommended that the police and fire rescue units set up a mobile rapid ambulance team. At present, our country’s police, fire and ambulance units mainly use four-wheel (or above) vehicles and special vehicles as the main rescue vehicles. If there is a narrow road space or traffic congestion, the current vehicles will not be enough to reach the accident scene in the first time. To sum up, it is suggested that a police and fire rescue leading mobile ambulance team with vehicles such as ""ordinary heavy locomotives"" or ""large heavy locomotives"" should be added, and they should arrive at the scene quickly when they are on duty. The firefighting is used to judge the situation, and the ambulance is used for emergency first aid, so that when the follow-up special four-wheel (or above) professional vehicles arrive, the ambulance duties can be arranged more quickly, so as to facilitate the smooth execution of ambulance.']"

My suggestion is to increase the fire warning lights in each room. If you don’t hear the broadcast, you can see the fire warning lights flashing. If the TV strengthens publicity, you will get used to paying attention to whether the warning lights are on and whether the fire broadcasting sound is there. The escape route prompt board is changed to a position 30 cm above the ground. Often the escape board is above the head. When thick smoke occurs, the escape board cannot play a role, and it can almost only be used as an observation line before the fire occurs. Escape broadcasts should not be monotonous about a fire. Often the broadcast will only say ""fire, escape quickly"", which will only increase the sense of tension. If experts are invited to study how to effectively guide the escape route, let alone how to wait for rescue when escape is impossible, or related precautions, this will reduce the tension. Almost all KTV employees are working-students. Experience is not much. Unless there is education and training, otherwise they will not deal with it. How to issue an order, here is a brief thought. For example, if there is a fire on the fifth floor, escape quickly. If there is a fire on the fifth floor, escape quickly. If there is a fire on the fifth floor, escape quickly.

At present, the fire extinguishers that I have access to are all set by the public sector. Most of them are dry powder fire extinguishers, which are bulky and heavy. They have a service life of three years and must be handed over to the fire department for replacement. Now that science and technology are changing with each passing day, simple and effective fire extinguishing appliances are constantly being introduced, and the replacement of administrative norms has been unable to keep up with the progress of equipment.

The addition of residential alarms can gain escape time and ensure life safety in the event of a fire. It has been publicized for many years in China. Even though the fire protection law was passed several years ago, everyone thinks that my house will not catch fire because there is no penalty. Therefore, no matter whether it is an illegal construction or the owner is unwilling to install a fire alarm that only costs a few hundred yuan. Most of the penthouses in China are rented out. In view of the fact that there have been many fires in domestic rented apartments with penthouses and penthouses, which have caused a large number of deaths and injuries among renters in various districts.

In addition, the current fire protection laws only recommend installation, and there are no mandatory installation of fire alarms and other related fire-fighting equipment.

If the local fire bureaus report that they do not cooperate with the implementation plan to install “residential fire alarms”, the construction management office will give priority to forcible demolition. The Taipei City Construction Management Office and the Fire Department have already handled the case. The Fire Department of the Ministry of the Interior should immediately work together across departments and counties and cities, and as long as it is transferred to Taipei City for simultaneous processing, it can effectively reduce disasters in counties and cities across the country. Fire disaster news will never be forgotten because of time, and it will always be imprinted in the hearts of the families of the victims. The Fire Department of the Ministry of the Interior will move to help fire departments across the country handle it together.

However, in-service students often have full-time work and have no time to take so many courses, which will not take up too many resources of the school. At the same time, there are few scholarships to apply for. First, the tuition fees for the second year are calculated based on 3 courses (there is a fixed amount, and you can take courses to your fullest). According to the principle of user fees, it is unreasonable to require such a requirement for social workers, which is tantamount to discouraging lifelong learning. Now that money is not easy to earn, it is no wonder that the number of doctoral students in universities is decreasing. I hope that the Ministry of Education will communicate with universities. Instead of worrying about not receiving students, it is better to charge reasonable fees and encourage all people to study. Also refer to some states in the United States. It’s not just the talent classes at the Evergreen Academy. Universities should be opened up so that the elderly can freely choose courses and learn together with young people. Many of us are high-level intellectuals, and our pensions have been cut, so we have no money to pay high tuition fees. We want to cultivate knowledge and second skills.

Therefore, making English an official language can create a foreign language environment so that English can become a mother tongue, so that everyone can learn English naturally. Second, creating an English-speaking environment can be in line with international standards, so that English-speaking countries in Europe and the United States will increase their willingness to visit Taiwan and increase the number of aircraft warehouses that receive orders. Third, reduce the burden on parents and students. At present, many schools of higher education require English proficiency.

According to the official website of the Ministry of Education: According to the ""2030 Bilingual National Policy Development Blueprint"" of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education aims to ""cultivate bilingual talents in Taiwan to go global and fully activate the bilingual activation of the education system"". Through five major strategies, such as accelerating the activation of teaching and life, expanding English human resources, making good use of technology to popularize individualized learning, promoting the internationalization of the education system, and loosening regulations to establish a flexible mechanism, the Ministry of Education strengthens students\' ability to use English in life and future workplace competitiveness. In the past few years, junior high schools and elementary schools in New Taipei City and Taipei City have successively opened up shortages of bilingual teachers in various subjects. But in fact, we have not yet matured in the part of teacher training. As a result, there are vacancies but qualified people are in single digits. How to choose suitable professional teachers. The second point: primary and secondary schools are in the early stage of English enlightenment, and the amount of words and basic sentence patterns cannot be absorbed well. Immediately, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, citizenship, and even puppetry must be taught bilingually. How to explain and appreciate traditional culture and art in English? This is why we question the feasibility and necessity of the immediate implementation of the bilingual policy. Putting the cart before the horse at present, we should first cultivate students’ basic English ability to a certain level, and at the same time require the on-site teachers to pass the English advanced test or study training to achieve a teaching mode that can be used in parallel with bilingual teaching, instead of putting aside the teacher’s major, and then find a group of teachers who are not professional but capable of teaching English, and let them enter the site to force students who are no longer interested in learning into a corner and give up learning. How to truly improve students’ future competitiveness in the workplace does not depend solely on English. Primary and secondary school students are still just beginning to explore the world. In order to achieve policy goals, using on-site students and teachers as guinea pigs for experiments, isn’t it returning to the myth of constructive teaching? The moon in foreign countries is not necessarily full. Only by gradually guiding students’ basic subject abilities in a way that they can easily understand and familiar language can we see hope. Then, will the Ministry of Education or various administrative agencies start to communicate in English simultaneously? Press conferences will also be held in English? Strengthen the international outlook and English listening skills of the people of the country~', 'We need a macroscopic and clear purpose of using English and an overall promotion strategyWith the development of the global layout of the industry, the government and the public have a clearer understanding and demand for English, and the quality of relevant policies is gradually improving: including: bilingual high schools will be fully open http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/paper/23074 The Ministry of Education established a committee and proposed a plan to ""promote English as a second official language"". http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/2222329 Recruiting Overseas Talents The Ministry of Education evaluates the addition of bilingual classes in primary and secondary schools http://www.ner.gov.tw/news/?recordId=42977&_sp=detail However, there are still some shortcomings, and it is necessary to more actively strengthen the planning and promotion of the overall supporting system. Some insights are as follows: From the content of the above-mentioned policy messages , It seems that they are more inclined to serve specific ethnic groups, such as solving the science park and the school environment for children returning to China or coming to work in Taiwan, or focusing on some classes in some public primary and secondary schools, only taking care of a small number of people. However, since most people with sufficient knowledge know that English is a particularly important and necessary global language tool platform, it is absolutely necessary for us to take care of the rights and opportunities of most citizens to learn and use, and we cannot just stay in a transitional coping mentality! In the development of Xiaolong, we (Taiwan) were exposed to the environment of modern advanced science and technology earlier, which made us industrialize earlier than neighboring countries. However, for decades, we may have been obsessed with the use of cheap labor in the mainland and Southeast Asia. Instead, we have slightly grasped the opportunity and failed to actively improve the purpose and degree of English use to a state where all people can use it fluently! We are still in a predicament that is not sufficiently forward-looking, nor can we consider the follow-up medium and long-term development! Our current situation! The system may only train about 3-5% of the language elites in a certain age group every year, that is, there are about 3000-5000 new people every year, while the vast majority of the people in Singapore and Hong Kong are English-literate elites, that is, there are about 100,000-150,000 new people every year. Almost a large number of international companies’ Asian headquarters are in Singapore, Hong Kong, and mainland China. We can only act as second-hand regional agents, and the profits are in the hands of others. Although the ability to fully use English is only a part of modern life, it is not a panacea, but it is very important. We should not face it with a careless or perfunctory attitude. Our English language use purposes and education policies should be done as soon as possible, and we must establish a complete macro-vision strategy and positioning, and take into account medium and long-term planning and investment at any time, and proceed proactively and gradually , Otherwise, compared to Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea’s national income and international and domestic competitiveness, the gap may still widen! Even after 10-20 years, even the English level and internationalization of the mainland, which is clamoring for the revival of nationalism all day long, may surpass us by a lot! Making good use of limited funds and resources enables us to improve the English proficiency of primary and secondary schools, universities and the whole people more quickly and efficiently. In 10 years, we can train about 50-80% of Chinese elites every year, that is, about 50,000-80,000 newcomers per year. To achieve a sufficiently forward-looking overall ability is indeed one of the most critical decisive factors! On the basis of the main direction of the bilingual class, at the same time establish ""Chinese and English vocabulary parallel school textbooks"" IV.Chinese and English vocabulary parallel school textbookshttp://www.chromnet.net/Chinese and English vocabulary parallel school textbooks.aspx Bilingual classes or non-bilingual classes use the same textbooks, except that non-bilingual classes do not require English. In these environments, gradually build a complete cognitive and adaptive ability, so as to be able to exert more efficient learning and career development planning and practical results! The principle is like painting, first apply a layer of primer, and then apply 1 or 2 layers of paint. This primer is for everyone (bilingual classes or non-bilingual classes), so that all new generations of students can fully realize its importance through continuous contact during their growth process, and naturally be more flexible and more efficient. Long-term learning planning and investment. In addition to the goals of promoting the extension of foreign talents mentioned in the aforementioned policies, medium- and long-term help such as: 1. It can mostly or completely solve the problems of over-establishment of universities and insufficient enrollment, because we have a global language environment, and it is expected that the supply will be in short supply. 2. It can make our technical and vocational education more developed. Technical personnel can directly read global technology and equipment information, and generally achieve international quality. 3. It can make our tourism and cultural exchanges truly global and truly stable. .4. More effectively enhance the ability of local and global people to understand each other and cooperate with each other. Establishing a universal and efficient learning awareness and cognitive environment is a very critical foundation for all learning and development. Within 10 years, the proportion of language elites in each age group will increase from 3-5% to 30-50%. It requires our old and new generations to be more systematically integrated and comprehensively actively invested in order to achieve a more comprehensive competitiveness in the overall development of the global field , look forward to your joint efforts!']"

Today, not all aborigines are disadvantaged groups, and students who do not have aboriginal ancestry are less able to learn. Today everyone is receiving the same education, and the resources they receive should be the same.

Because he studied hard, he got the same test scores as the aboriginal students, but in the end the aboriginal students were admitted to high-quality universities. Just because he is an aboriginal student, he was given a fixed percentage of extra points. This is very unfair to ordinary students.

Adding points together to deepen the gap between urban and rural areas: The law does not clearly distinguish the aboriginal students from the mountainous areas and the aboriginal students who have been relocated to the plains. The addition of points makes it impossible for the aborigines in the mountainous areas, who have already had a very serious urban-rural gap, to compete with the aborigines in the plains, resulting in their vulnerable status being unable to be protected. 2. For aborigines who are economically well off, their bonus points should be reduced to protect the truly disadvantaged: the vested interests of this law are often the aborigines who have no worries about food and clothing, no urban-rural gap, and sufficient resources. For such identities, their bonus points should be reduced to increase competition among mountain aborigines. 3. The proportion of aboriginals who drop out of school remains high, and the economic subsidy plan for ""vulnerable"" aborigines: In addition to the problem of adding points together, the rate of aboriginals who drop out of school after entering higher education is much higher than that of ordinary students. 4. A ""review mechanism"" should be added to avoid the purpose of obtaining identities for extra points, and distinguishing urban and rural aborigines and economic conditions and other criteria, so as to avoid making the disadvantaged become more disadvantaged.

However, for those who have obtained the certificate of aboriginal culture and language ability, 35% of the original total score will be added for calculation.

Although everyone knows that they have some difficulties or special circumstances, and the government adopts this ""bonus point"" policy to help them, the word ""bonus point"" inevitably makes people feel unequal and differential treatment, which has caused a lot of controversy. Taking the academic test as an example, the bonus points system is mainly divided into two parts, one is the literal bonus points, and the other is the guaranteed quota. Qualifications for obtaining extra points for aboriginal people: 1. To have an aboriginal identity, you can get an additional 10% interest. 2. In addition to self-certification, if you have an aboriginal cultural or language certification, you can get a score + 35% interest. In addition to bonus points, each school also provides an additional 2% of places for aborigines, which means: instead of competing with ordinary students for places, you can only compete with other aborigines for an additional 2% of places (the number of places is calculated by the unconditional entry method). Reasons for objection This unequal preferential treatment is of course the reason for our objection 1. Inequality. For example: now some people with aboriginal status have been sinicized a long time ago, and their residence and educational resources are not significantly different from ordinary people, but they can get extra points in the exam. This is unequal. There are four things that are unreasonable: 1. Some aboriginal people with deep Sinicization have gradually lost touch with their original aboriginal culture, and even do not even know their own culture and language, almost no different from ordinary people. 2. Originally, considering poor family conditions and insufficient resources, they wanted to provide subsidies, but they did not directly provide assistance to low-income households and other more direct ways. Instead, they devised a detour to create an aborigines bonus system, which not only failed to achieve the expected results, but also caused the aborigines to be discriminated against. 3. Most of the aborigines who can get extra points into good schools are aboriginals living in cities, not aboriginals in mountainous areas who really lack resources. Even in terms of ability, to secure guaranteed places, urban aborigines who are more familiar with mainstream culture are popular, and cannot directly help aboriginals in mountainous areas. 4. The extra points policy is the government’s compensation to the aborigines, but taking language certificates as an example, learning one’s own culture under the guidance of the mainstream consciousness will not be as effective as expected, and it will not help aboriginal language inheritance. Facing these problems, we have come up with two corresponding methods: 1. Offer language and culture courses. 2. Strengthen rural education']"

Although it is classified as the same level as a car in terms of regulations, in use, a large scooter is usually used for traveling around the island, commuting, or conveniently carrying family and children.

Investing in the next generation is investing in the future of the country. The birth rate is low...More evidence shows that the government has used a lot of resources to take care of the elderly, which has caused a huge problem in Hong Kong! Moreover, because this population aging problem has caused a lot of inconvenience to the society, Hong Kong will establish many institutions related to population aging, such as: Social Welfare Department, Elderly Health Care Center, Hong Kong Social Welfare Services and other comprehensive services waiting for it. That is to say, in this society, there are more and more old people than young people. Population aging is a problem that every country will face, but there are differences in the degree of priority. The number of newborns in my country is declining rapidly year by year. By around 2022, the total population of Taiwan will reach its peak and then begin to decrease. The reduction in the number of newborns, coupled with the increase in the average life expectancy of the population, has led to a rapid increase in the proportion of the elderly population. This phenomenon of population aging has been common in advanced countries and has caused many problems. It has also been highly valued and countermeasures have been adopted one after another. The main causes of population aging are the extension of life expectancy and the decline of birth rate. Due to the increasingly affluent life and the rapid advancement of medicine, the average life expectancy of the elderly in Taiwan has exceeded 75 years old, and there are many elderly people who live to the age of 80 or 90. In contrast, the birth rate of Taiwan's population has dropped to less than 1%, and each woman of childbearing age has only one child in her lifetime. Three children, one more than the developed country average. Six people is still low; in the past year, more than 10% of the newborns were born to mainland or foreign brides. The various problems reflected by this low birth rate cannot be ignored.

These people who go abroad are called international migrant workers. Overseas, their human rights are often oppressed. Today, foreign migrant workers can be seen everywhere in Taiwan. Taiwan employs a large number of foreign workers because of cheap wages, but there are often problems such as ""complicated procedures"" and ""different qualifications"". 90% of foreign workers come to Taiwan through agency companies, thus creating an agency system. In modern society, from the introduction of immigrant workers to the process of management and follow-up services, because employers are not familiar with laws and regulations, the application process, and the life and work adaptation of immigrant workers during their stay in Taiwan, they need to rely on intermediaries to provide services, so human resources agency companies have been formed. -Intermediary system As an intermediary, the intermediary can help employers and migrant workers communicate, train migrant workers, and handle legal procedures, so that the procedures can be carried out more smoothly and quickly. But behind the scenes of helping things work, some people also took the opportunity to exploit immigrant workers, violating the human rights and right to work of immigrant workers. It is hoped that the government can directly sign contracts with foreign migrant workers, so that the exploitation of intermediaries can be skipped.', 'The proposals in this case focus on how to protect employers, deal with the escape and loss of contact of foreign workers, and then provide penalties to increase resistance to escape. Taiwan\'s salaries for foreign workers are the highest in Asia (at least the top few), plus benefits such as health insurance for foreign workers, it is competitive in the foreign labor market in Asia. However, Taiwan\'s current system focuses on protecting foreign workers and not protecting employers. There are 50,000 foreign workers who flee and lose contact in Taiwan every year. According to the statistics of the National Immigration Agency, employers in Taiwan have no way to appeal and have no protection when encountering foreign workers maliciously disappearing or fleeing. Usually surrender is to get enough remuneration and decide to return to the country before surrendering on your own. According to the provisions of the ""Employment Service Law"", if a foreign worker loses contact, if the migrant worker is a family caregiver, the employer must wait for 3 months; if the migrant worker\'s work is not a family care worker (such as a domestic helper), the employer must wait 6 months before applying to the Ministry of Labor for replacement. Leaving aside the domestic helpers or factory migrant workers who are supplementary manpower, the families who usually apply for home care need to have ""patients"" who need to be cared for. When foreign workers lose contact for no reason, they usually maliciously abandon their caregivers (victims) and flee. It is extremely unreasonable to punish the ""victims"" and their families. Let these patients and their families who need manpower for care, have already faced the loss of foreign caregivers, but they have to be punished for three months and cannot apply for replacement. Even those who lose contact within a certain period of time will also affect the operation of legal intermediaries. But in fact, the root cause of the many escaped foreign workers is not the employers or agents, but the foreign workers, illegal agents, and illegal employers. Therefore, this case suggests: 1. Add an online reporting system so that employers can report to the Immigration Department online or through the app if they lose contact within 12 hours, and directly enter the reporting system to help the police or competent authorities to investigate. According to the current law, the lost foreign workers can report for the first time during the first to three days of losing contact and escaping, and then wait for three days to report before formally reporting and confirming the loss. In this way, if it is a national holiday, the escape date will accumulate for more than seven days. With the convenience of living in a one-day circle in Taiwan, three days is too long. 2. Stop the provision that foreign workers escape and punish employers who cannot make up for three months. Amend the ""Employment Service Law"" to stipulate that foreign workers lose contact and restrict employers from hiring replacements for three months, especially the part of family care workers who take care of patients. Another example is the current Wuhan pneumonia epidemic, which makes it more difficult to introduce foreign workers. If there are still nearly 2,000 foreign workers who have escaped recently, half of them are family care workers, which means that there are 1,000 families. They will not be able to apply for replacements for three months. In this way, there will be a window period of at least half a year in total. 3. Actively ban escaped foreign workers Every foreign worker who comes to work in Taiwan has a mobile phone. Fleeing and losing contact with foreign workers is like a breach in social security caused by illegal workers in Taiwan. Imagine that every year there are 50,000 foreigners who should not be in Taiwan, stay in Taiwan in violation of the law, and even work illegally. There is no need to pay taxes, no penalties, and it has created breaches in the epidemic prevention caused by illegal nursing care or foreign workers like the new crown pneumonia. Therefore, it is necessary to ""set social security above personal privacy."" It is suggested that every foreign care worker working in Taiwan must apply for a mobile phone number with his real identity. It must be a system that can track his phone calls and track his whereabouts. In case of escape or loss of contact, the tracking function will be activated. Just like the current cell newsletter, the mobile app can notify and report the general public or public power enforcement units (such as the police, immigration department) who have escaped or lost contact with foreign workers. 4. Foreign workers who are lost, found or surrendered, should face fines and criminal charges. Foreign workers who escape and lose contact, especially those who abandon care recipients with intentions and actions that cause harm, should face fines and criminal charges before being repatriated. Therefore, during their working period, they are not allowed to remit all their salaries out of Taiwan, so as to prevent foreign workers from evading all due responsibilities on the grounds of their financial status after they come to the case. This suggestion refers to the regulations of Singapore. According to the regulations, if there are illegal reasons such as illegal work and illegal residence, the immigrant worker must face a fine and criminal responsibility before being sent back to the country. And limit their chances of coming to Taiwan to work again in the future. 5. The performance system for employers to give feedback to foreign workers If the foreign workers do not meet the requirements, or there are other regulations that must be dispatched, the employer can use the feedback system provided by the government after sending the foreign helper back, and this feedback will be sent to various agencies and foreign labor employers, and future employers will see this feedback. It is suggested that if there are unqualified foreign workers, after they are sent back, this mechanism must be established as a two-way evaluation. When foreign workers can choose to change employers, employers must also have the same mechanism to protect themselves. 6. Employers may stop hiring unqualified foreign workers and send them back to the country. When there are reasons for foreign workers to change employers, or to flee and threaten agents or employers, the responsible unit may establish an evaluation and counseling mechanism. If the counseling fails, the employer will introduce the next foreign domestic helper, and after the unqualified foreign worker is sent back to the country, he will not be allowed to work in Taiwan again. This can protect the rights of employers and reduce the consequences of foreign workers fleeing as a solution.

This regulation protects the good intentions of domestic workers, but the reason why employers still hire foreign workers is usually because the wages of foreign workers are lower and their job requirements are lower than those of their own nationalities. Therefore, there is a demand for foreign workers, especially foreign caregivers. Therefore, the premise of this case is the necessary existence of foreign workers, rather than reviewing their deprivation of domestic labor. As mentioned above, the demand for foreign workers is to make up for the content and conditions of the job, and non-domestic workers are willing to do it. The proposals in this case focus on how to protect employers, deal with the escape and loss of contact of foreign workers, and then provide penalties to increase resistance to escape.

When foreign workers lose contact for no reason, they usually abandon their caregivers (victims) maliciously and run away. Why are the “victims” and their families punished? Why are these patients and their families who need care workers punished for three months and cannot apply for replacements? Previously, the law stipulated that if a foreign worker lost contact or escaped after less than a year of service, the agency would be deducted points. This can also urge the agency to help regulate foreign workers and assist employers to report. But in fact, the root of the problem is not the employer or the agent, but the foreign workers, illegal agents, and illegal employers.

Teachers should do what teachers should do."", 'Unjustifiable and reasonable reasons for schools to control hairRecently, it has been found that many schools prevent students from changing their hairstyles. Many schools still have various ""hair ban"" systems. For those who violated the regulations, the school administrators cut the students\' hair into ""dogs eating their heads"" or changed the color of the students\' hair, which seriously violated the personal dignity of the students. I believe this is the serious dissatisfaction of the Student Rights Promotion Association, and hopes to formally and substantively lift the ""hair ban"" on campus. There are often students whose hair color has never been dyed, but they have been troubled by students. Parents can also confirm that they have not dyed. As for the so-called teaching and professional needs, it means that certain types of schools (such as catering schools, vocational schools for hairdressing and beauty) require students to limit their hairstyles to a certain style (not necessarily for hair length) in order to conform to their school-running characteristics, and when it is clearly stated in the enrollment brochures, there is no reason to deny its legitimacy in a modern democratic society ruled by law. In addition, there are different opinions on whether the school can use the reasons of ""learning the life of groups and discipline"" and ""group education"" as the justification for the ban, and it is worth studying. As for the school\'s past empty words such as ""this is the school\'s tradition"" and ""students should look like students"", as reasons for restricting students\' rights, they are untenable. Schools certainly have legitimate reasons to control students\' hairstyles, but what are the means of control? What is the principle of compliance with health and safety? I’m afraid it’s not specific enough. Information provided by: Human Rights Education Consulting Network of the Ministry of Education [Analysis of the Legal Issues of Campus “Banning”]']"

We hope that the law can be amended. The location of the gold stove in the temple must have a hinterland with a radius of 10 to 20 meters, otherwise it is not allowed to be installed. I hope that the Legislative Yuan and the Environmental Protection Agency can pass the revision of the Air Pollution Law and face up to the pollution caused by the gold stoves in temples. Request legislation to regulate pollution sources away from residential areas. The current Air Pollution Law regulates air pollution from factories or motor vehicles, but there is no clear written statement on the banning of waste smoke from golden stoves in temples, making it difficult for front-line environmental inspectors to issue fines for golden stoves in temples that cause air pollution. Legislators are requested to promote the revision of the Air Pollution Law and include the following provisions: Temple golden stoves must be at least 20 meters away from the nearest residential house, and those that have been established but do not meet this requirement must be moved or stopped. Reason : The gold furnace is too close to the houses, even if environmental protection equipment is installed, there is not enough distance to dilute the exhaust gas. The gold furnace should be set up in an open and well-ventilated place. At the same time, I hope that the Environmental Protection Agency will revise the banning method of air pollution and include the following provisions: Similar to the way of banning squid cars, the public will be allowed to report the air pollution of the golden furnace of the temple with photos or videos, and a reward for reporting will be set up. Reason : The air pollution caused by some burning behaviors was almost exhausted by the time the environmental protection personnel arrived at the scene, and the public should be allowed to record or take photos to report.', 'For the sake of the environment, the air, and your and my health, please ask the government to limit the bad habits of burning gold paper and setting off firecrackersAlthough burning gold paper is a religious activity that has been around for a long time, the government should slowly guide and restrict this untimely ritual activity and then gradually ban it. Here, we suggest that initially, the burning of gold paper should be restricted except for the Ching Ming Festival, and then gradually abolish this bad habit to protect the health of the Chinese people. In addition, the environmental damage caused by firecrackers is not inferior to that of burning gold paper. A large number of firecrackers will cause noise pollution, air pollution, and cannon debris all over the ground after the firecrackers are set off. It is recommended that the government initially restrict the setting off of firecrackers on weekdays except for the New Year.', ""Responding to Dean Lai's meritorious deeds, please prohibit government departments from making budgets for fireworks display, reduce air pollution, and reduce budgetary expenditures1. Many public departments in China will release fireworks to celebrate Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, National Day, New Year’s Eve, and other festivals. However, the main raw material of fireworks is made of gunpowder. When setting off fireworks, the explosive combustion of gunpowder will cause air pollution problems. These air pollutants are divided into suspended particles, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide...etc. All gaseous or granular pollutants in the air fall to the ground along with rain, snow and other precipitation forms. The air pollutants produced by setting off fireworks directly or indirectly lead to the generation of acid rain. With the harm of acid rain, these pollution will cause damage to buildings, lakes or visibility, and will eventually return to humans. After the persecution of living things in water and on land, the food that human beings rely on is reduced, and it may even endanger our health. Acid rain has caused many negative impacts on the environment, including affecting the function of people's respiratory system, making them feel uncomfortable or allergic, damaging the appearance of buildings, and destroying natural ecology. These are all negative effects, and we should avoid acid rain in the sky again, so first of all, we can try to reduce or stop setting off fireworks and firecrackers. 2. At present, in order to reduce air pollution, many private temples have banned incense, but the government and public departments, ignoring the poor air quality in Taiwan, continue to budget a large amount of fireworks. Take the Taipei 101 New Year’s Eve fireworks show as an example. In just a few minutes, the cost ranged from 3 million in 35 seconds in 2004 to 60 million in 288 seconds in 2018. The Tourism Bureau allocated 20 million in funds. Miaoli County spent 200 million in setting off fireworks during the Fireworks Festival, but the county government’s salary could not be paid. In 2017 New Year’s Eve, 15 counties and cities spent 73 million a day in Taiwan. Germany, Taiwan's public sector, spends only a few minutes of fireworks a year, but spends hundreds of millions of Taiwan's budget, government departments should prohibit the compilation of fireworks budgets, Hou Men is good at practicing, all public sector officials and Dean Lai will do meritorious deeds, and Taiwan will have a clean sky""]"

The government should open it up so that these people can take their pet birds with them on public transportation instead of allowing these people to use smuggling. Both dogs and cats are open, and birds should also be open! And the bird flu is gone, people have human rights, and birds should have equal rights', 'Pet birds find their way into mass transitIn view of the fact that more and more people are raising birds recently, owners of pet birds often have to smuggle in, raise them on behalf of others or keep them at home when they take transportation, which is very inconvenient for owners of pet birds. And pet dogs, cats and other pets can be caged to take public transportation. Can pet birds get the same treatment? Generally, the reason for refusing to allow pet birds to enter public transportation is nothing more than bird flu, but unlike wild birds outside, pet birds have a very low chance of being exposed to bird flu viruses, and basically there is no great risk. Therefore, it is feasible to bring pet birds into public transportation, and it should not be refused to enter public transportation', 'Breeders and sellers of pet birds should be included in specific pet businesses to formulate relevant management measuresSince the ""Animal Protection Law"" was promulgated and implemented in 1988, although it has clearly regulated the breeding, trading, fostering and raising behaviors of pet owners and pet owners, it is limited to pet dogs and cats. In recent years, many people have begun to have pet birds. However, the competent authority has not formulated management regulations for owners of breeding and trading pet birds. As a result, many owners set up birdhouses in residential areas, causing harm to air quality and the health of nearby residents. What\'s more, whether the owners can protect the birds during the breeding process Health, also unknown. Therefore, if we can formulate owner regulations similar to those for dogs and cats, and establish permits for aviaries, it will be possible to resolve disputes between owners and neighbors, check the health of pet birds, and allow the government to effectively take stock of poultry and bird breeding sites within its jurisdiction during the avian flu epidemic, and achieve a win-win situation. Current dilemma: 1. The aviary is set up in a residential area, and the health hazards caused not only include respiratory diseases, such as allergies, asthma, asthma, pneumonia, etc., but also skin allergies caused by contact with bird excrement, and neurasthenia caused by prolonged exposure to birdsong, which will lead to sleep deprivation, fatigue, headaches, immune imbalance and other health problems. 2. The aviary will also pose a threat to the nearby air quality, including the increase of suspended particles and the increase of odor. 3. When poultry and birds encounter an epidemic of bird flu, although the aviary is often surrounded by screens, it is still a semi-open space. In addition, the aviary is not within the scope of epidemic control, which may easily cause dead spots for epidemic prevention. 4. The average lifespan of birds is short and fragile. If the owner does not have professional qualifications, the life of pet birds will be endangered. 5. If the breeding environment has not established norms and management regulations, in addition to causing the above-mentioned dead spots for epidemic prevention, it will also endanger the lives of pet birds. 6. The market transaction price of pet birds is not open and transparent. If relevant management measures are formulated, black market transactions will be suppressed. 7. When the pet bird is lost, or when the pet bird is caught, the owner cannot be contacted. Suggestions: 1. According to Article 3 of the Animal Protection Law, the first paragraph of pet birds is ""vertebrates raised or managed by human beings"". Therefore, pet birds must be included in the ""Specific Pet Industry Management Measures"", and the owners must have the information in Article 4 of the measures. 2. The aviary shall be in accordance with Article 4 of the ""Administrative Measures for Specific Pet Businesses"" and the Regulations on Aviary Registration and Management in the ""Livestock Law"". 3. Aviaries should not be set up within 10 meters of neighboring houses or on the roof of buildings to avoid air pollution and health problems among neighbors. 4. In order to prevent bird flu, the owner should set up birdhouses and draw up procedures for quarantine, culling, and restocking in accordance with the relevant regulations of the Council of Agriculture. 5.

The marriage is facing annulment!1. Wedge After returning from her honeymoon, Didi was unhappy and often sighed unconsciously. One day Didi said: ""Bill, put on a mask, let\'s go to the rooftop to chat"" ""Oh, okay"" When I arrived on the rooftop, before I could ask, Didi shouted excitedly: ""What kind of civil law, pedantic!"" ""What\'s wrong with you?"" Obstacles, she always presses me with laws, I... really can\'t be humane."" ""What humanity? She wants you to do good deeds?"" Didi: ""Our country\'s civil law was enacted in the 1930s, and it still retains the regulations in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Marriage parties must be ""humane"", otherwise the other party can annul the marriage. Humanity here is of course not social relations, but sex."" ""Hey! Many Chinese people still don\'t know about such a good channel. It\'s just a ""suggestion""! As long as 5,000 people sign up, we will have the opportunity to remind the government to reform. Let\'s file a case and delete this old regulation together..."" Didi looked at the blue sky again... (unfinished... 60 days later, I hope the change will come true) 2. The main appeal: remove the civil law\'s provision that ""marriages that are not humane and cannot be governed will be annulled"". 3. The reason for the proposed deletion (1) The ability to have sexual intercourse is not a prerequisite for the establishment of marriage. According to Article 982, marriage should be 1. written, 2. signed by two or more witnesses, and 3. both parties should register the marriage with the household registration authority. If there is no cure for sex and the marriage can be revoked, it should be stipulated in Article 982 that when the marriage is registered, a ""certificate of human rights"" must be submitted before the marriage can be registered. (2) Premarital sex has become more and more popular. Our country\'s civil law was enacted in the 1930s of the last century. At that time, marriages were established mostly through the media. Only at the moment when the red hijab is lifted, can one see what the other party looks like. Under the previous emphasis on family inheritance, the inability to have sex is a heinous crime in marriage. It is understandable that the civil law has this provision. In addition to partly because of religion or values, whether the other party can have sex, in the era when premarital sex is prevalent, if you really care about whether the other party is usable and useful, you will know after trying it, why wait until after marriage. In front of the judge, let the judge prove that it is unusable and revoke the marriage, which is so humiliating to the personality. Article 19 of the Consumer Protection Law stipulates that consumers of special transactions may terminate the contract by returning the goods or giving a written notice within seven days after receiving the goods or services. The provisions of Article 995 of the Civil Code are like after getting married and finding that it can’t be used, and then asking the court to revoke the marriage, “I don’t want it anymore, return the product.” (3) Love is not the foundation of marriage. The parties to a husband and wife have the right to sexual autonomy. Although the husband and wife have the obligation to live together, the will of both parties is the prerequisite. To maintain a marriage, in addition to the obligation of ""cohabitation"", mutual support in the heart and spiritual compatibility are all conditions for the continuation of the marriage. The civil law directly stipulates that the inability to have sex can be revoked. Doesn\'t it affirm that love is the foundation of marriage?', 'Oppose same-sex marriage, oppose amending Civil Code Section 9721. The legalization of same-sex marriage will consume huge resources of the country and affect the government’s efforts to fight the economy. Some people who support same-sex marriage think that it will not affect them. However, the legalization of same-sex marriage will actually change the definition of marriage fundamentally. Almost all laws and regulations related to marriage, relatives, reproduction, property inheritance, insurance and pensions need to be reviewed and revised. The impact is not insignificant. 2. Same-sex marriage has ignited social wars in many countries. Taiwan’s hasty promotion will inevitably cause social controversy and internal friction. France’s adoption of same-sex marriage has triggered the largest street protest in France in 30 years. Taiwan\'s hasty promotion will inevitably lead to more confrontation and internal friction in the country and society. 3. Neither the European Court of Human Rights nor the U.S. Supreme Court has reached a conclusion. Taiwan should not be the first guinea pig in the Chinese area. At present, only 8 EU member states recognize same-sex marriage, and a small number of countries recognize that they enjoy ""some form of registered relationship"". The U.S. Supreme Court also only agreed that states can decide on their own, but still reserved the definition of marriage without making any judgments. In Chinese areas that value marriage and inheritance from generation to generation, there is no country that recognizes same-sex marriage. 4. Same-sex marriage does not have the possibility of natural birth, which is not conducive to family continuation and population development in Taiwan. Taiwan has a serious problem of declining birthrates, and its fertility rate has dropped rapidly. It ranks last in the global rankings, lower than Singapore, South Korea, and Japan. The low birth rate will cause many problems such as insufficient labor force and productivity, and reduced fiscal and tax revenues, which will accelerate the aging of society and seriously affect national competitiveness. The marriage of one man and one woman and the natural inheritance of childbearing are in the public interest of promoting the sustainable development of Taiwan\'s population. 5. AIDS is most common among men who have sex with men, and it has become the top ten cause of death among teenagers. According to the statistics of the CDC, homosexual sex is the highest risk factor for Taiwan people, followed by drug abuse and needle use. Among the cases where the source of infection has been identified from January to July in 2010, 74.57% of the AIDS patients were infected due to MSM. The annual AIDS medical expenses paid by the state have reached 3 billion, accounting for more than half of the CDC budget, and it grows every year. The law is tantamount to encouraging homosexual behavior in disguise, which is extremely detrimental to AIDS prevention and government financial burden. 6. Same-sex marriage is not in the best interests of minor children In a long-term committed, stable, and legally guaranteed marriage between a man and a woman, children are most likely to receive good care and education from their parents. Based on the above reasons, Taiwan should adhere to the monogamous marriage system of one man and one woman, so that the next generation of Taiwan can grow and develop in a normal relationship between the sexes, so as to promote the stability and progress of Taiwan society.', 'Calling for Civil Law Marriage Contracts to Return to the Simple Contract EssenceToday\'s social atmosphere in our country has become more and more open. The imagination of marriage is also quite diverse. At the same time, the general public is constantly demanding that the restrictions on the rights and obligations of both parties in marriage be relaxed. And there are also success stories. For example: 1. my country\'s Interpretation Zi No. 748 has affirmed the right of same-sex marriage to exist. Now the Legislative Yuan has also enacted the ""Judicial Yuan Shizi No. 748 Interpretation and Implementation Law"". Marriage is no longer limited to heterosexual marriages, but same-sex marriages are also possible. 2. my country\'s Interpretation No. 791 has decriminalized adultery. Adultery in marriage is no longer punished by criminal law. The party claiming that its rights have been infringed can only request civil compensation from the other party for the contractual relationship. 3. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called ""Married Women Defend Their Rights"" has passed the second stage. The proposal advocates that women in a married relationship should be able to have an abortion of their own volition without the consent of the other party. Then the proposal was enthusiastically seconded, and there were many words of support on FB or the message area of \u200b\u200bthe proposal. It can be seen that the general public in today\'s society no longer thinks that the rights of spouses are the most important, and the rights of individual freedom and body rights are more important. 4. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called """"Affinity Law"": Prohibiting in-laws from interfering with both parties in a marriage with words, behaviors, and traditional customs, and implementing marriage autonomy and human rights within marriage"" has also been passed. The proposal advocates that any direct or collateral in-laws are prohibited from interfering with both parties in the marriage. The proposal has also been enthusiastically seconded. It can be seen that the general public now agrees that marriage is only a contract between the two parties. No one or in-laws has the right to intervene in this contract. That is, the marriage contract only exists between the parties. No one else has anything to do with the contract. 5. At present, on the public policy online participation platform, a proposal called ""Opening up single women to legally implement ""artificial insemination"" and ""test-tube baby"""" has also passed the seconding stage. Although the proposal was responded to, it failed to amend the law. However, it also received enthusiastic seconding from this proposal. It can also be seen that today\'s society no longer thinks that only married people are suitable for bearing and raising children. Although the proposal has not yet passed the seconding stage, the proposal advocates that the consent of the spouse is not required for vasectomy. It is similar to the proposal of ""married women defending their own rights"". It also no longer believes that the rights of the spouse are the most important, and that the rights of individual liberty and body are more important. From the above cases and various proposals, the public in our country now agrees that marriage should be only a contractual relationship between the parties, and should not be restricted by too many rights and obligations. The public policy network participates in various proposals on the platform. At the same time, it avoids the need for the public to make frequent proposals and second proposals. This proposal advocates returning the civil law marriage contract to the essence of a simple contract. The more specific requirements are as follows: 1. The conclusion of marriage does not require the witness of a witness. As long as the parties decide on their own free will, the marriage contract can be concluded. 2. The dissolution of marriage does not require the consent of all parties. Freedom to dissolve the marriage contract. However, if one party claims that his rights are damaged, he can request civil compensation from the other party for the contract. 3. Marriage is a private contract, and the state should not interfere too much. If the parties agree, marriage should not be limited to two people, but as long as the parties agree, there is no limit to the number of people. 4. Based on the liberalism of the contract, the parties to the marriage should not be restricted by their status. However, based on eugenics, parties with specific blood relatives should not enter into marriage. Those under a certain age are also based on eugenics and children\'s rights. 5. Based on respect for private law contracts and the humility of punishment, bigamy should be decriminalized in the same way as adultery. The party claiming that its rights have been violated can only claim civil compensation from the other party for the contractual relationship. 6. The effectiveness of the marriage contract should be limited to the parties and has nothing to do with others. Therefore, the existence of legal affinity should be removed. The rights and obligations formed by the marriage relationship are only valid between the parties. 7. In order to respect the freedom and property rights of individuals, the legal property system between marriage parties should be changed to the provisions of the separate property system. If there is no special contract and registration between the parties, the property system should automatically apply the separate property system. 8. In order to respect the right to freedom of the individual, the parties to a marriage should not assume cohabitation obligations, support obligations, or act as agents for each other.']"

A couple car with a flat tire in the opposite direction lost control and rushed into the opposite lane, resulting in the death of all three members of the small family. In this incident, the tires of the vehicles involved in the accident were insufficient in depth, overweight, unlicensed driver, and the use of recycled tires, all of which were among the causes of the accident. Relevant units should re-examine the existing regulations on tread pattern and load, and re-examine the current inspection methods. Whether recycled tires should continue to be legal, the penalties for non-compliant vehicles are also the same. http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20171024/1228127/ http://news.tvbs.com.tw/local/797922 The government’s regulations, inspection systems, penalties, and effectiveness of inspections for automobiles, motorcycles and other means of transportation have stagnated for many years. The relevant regulations have not kept pace with the times, and there is no effective implementation method. It is hoped that the relevant units will pay attention to it, re-examine the current regulations, add or revise them, and formulate how to effectively ensure that large passenger/truck vehicles that do not comply with the regulations are not driven on the road, so as to improve the safety of the car environment in Taiwan and avoid similar regrets from happening again.']"

The current ractopamine residues in American pigs in my country are 0.01ppm for non-visceral parts, 0.04ppm for liver, and 0.04ppm for kidney. However, this does not mean that our country’s standards are “as strict” as CODEX. In fact, the difference in this unit hides a mystery. A small difference may cause the clenbuterol content in pork to increase by 0.0049ppm unconsciously. Why is this so? For example, a piece of non-offal pork with a clenbuterol content of 0.0149ppm can be legally ""rounded up"" under domestic standards, so after rounding up, the test result will become a legal ""0.01ppm"". But if it is changed to ppb, this situation can be avoided, because 0.0149ppm is equal to 14.9ppb, which will become 15ppb after rounding, which will be illegal. From the above example, we can know the results caused by the different units, so we should change the testing unit from ppm to ppb to avoid being played with words by the government, prevent the above situation from happening, and protect the safety of Chinese food. Prohibition of the import of offal containing lycopene Ractopamine (clenbuterol) remains high in the lungs, stomach and intestines 12 hours after the drug is stopped. Asian countries have the habit of eating offal with high potential risks, so it is hoped that its import will be banned. According to the Codex assessment, the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of ractopamine per kilogram of body weight for adults is about 1 microgram (10-6 grams), which is a safe dose to eat every day and for a lifetime. Even so, the current experimental data cannot determine whether it will cause other side effects on the human body. The clinical manifestations of the subjects are tachycardia, muscle tremors in the limbs, and vomiting. For example, and one of them had heart palpitations, the experiment was terminated), and all the data were provided by Elanco, the American company responsible for manufacturing ractopamine, which lacked reliability and believed that the drug could not be scientifically guaranteed to be safe, so it was banned. We also hope that the import of viscera with the most residues of ractopamine can be banned before the inspection is complete, so as to reduce the health and safety concerns of Chinese people.', 'American pigs banned from campusAt the beginning, the national policy required importing American pigs, but it also told everyone that they could choose to eat or not. However, when American pigs entered schools, they forced children to eat these ractopamine-containing pork. When most Chinese people choose not to eat ractopamine pork, these imported ractopamine pork can only be supplied to places where there is no right to choose, such as schools or the military. This is forcing children to eat ractopamine pork.', ""Request the government to allow pig farmers in Taiwan to use ractopamineAt present, the government has agreed to open the import of foreign pork to our country, which must contain ractopamine. According to the relevant speeches and information provided by the my country Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health Services, we can know that as long as ractopamine follows the international standard, that is, the residue regulations of the International Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX), there is absolutely no need to be afraid of eating pork products containing ractopamine. Lai pig ≠ poisonous pig. The use of ractopamine can not only make it easier for pig farmers to raise pigs, but also reduce the cost of feeding. It can even achieve the environmental protection effect of helping the earth reduce carbon by reducing the use of feed. Moreover, 101 countries around the world allow the import of ractopamine pork. Even if my country opens up the use of ractopamine, there is no need to worry that my country's high-quality pork cannot be exported to the world. Therefore, in order to implement the rights to equality and freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of our country, and to make it easier for pig farmers in our country to raise pigs with low feeding costs. It is good to be able to stand at the same starting point and compete on an equal footing with other countries in the world that use ractopamine and lower the cost of pork.

For private schools, groups, and private institutions with a total number of employees of 67 or more, the number of persons with disabilities employing employability shall not be less than 1% of the total number of employees, and shall not be less than one person. Reason: Since the revision in 1996, the ratio has not been adjusted with the increase in the number of people with disabilities in my country for more than ten years. In the second quarter of 2019, the number of people with disabilities in my country was 1,190,738, accounting for 5% of the total population in the same period. The ratio was significantly different from the ratio when it was revised in 1996. The reason why the law was amended in 1996 was also because the employment ratio of the old law was based on the fact that the population with disabilities accounted for 0.75% of the national population when it was established in 1979, which resulted in an underestimation of the employment ratio. Now, the number of people with disabilities has reached 5% of the total population in our country. 2.

Instead, it is cheap to adopt 15% bonus points as a regulation that meets the requirements of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Disabled. Whether this approach really protects the rights of the disabled is debatable. However, starting from 2017, the bonus points for the handicapped were canceled and only the aborigines’ points were retained. It is said that the reason for the disability test is that the respective enterprises have conducted special examinations for disabled employees. However, not only are employees and employees different in terms of benefits, but also the complexity and importance of their work. Big loss. In addition, the public service organization has an interview as a re-examination. If only 15% of the initial test points are added to protect the employment rights and interests of the disabled, whether the score will be greatly reduced during the re-examination due to employment discrimination is not to be careless.

Please allow me to explain them one by one. 1. The safety of women and children In the future, unscrupulous people may use means such as changing certificates to enter and leave the women-only area to commit crimes (such as installing sneak shooting props such as pinholes, sneak shooting, sexual harassment, sexual assault, etc.). Interested people can follow women into women\'s areas by changing their ID cards. Before the stalking law can apply for protection orders, women are in a more vulnerable situation and encounter more personal safety threats. Women\'s doubts about suspected stalkers (such as tailgating into women\'s restrooms) will be overshadowed by words such as ""discrimination against transgender"", which will cause difficulties in the implementation of the harassment law and women\'s reporting. In severe cases, the stalking part of the harassment law may even be overshadowed. If transgender female prisoners are allowed to enter women\'s prisons, similar incidents of sexual assault in foreign prisons leading to pregnancy may occur. 2.

Women\'s testosterone concentration remained below 1/10 of the Olympic standard for a year, and their muscle strength did not decline.""

Underage sex education and hormone therapy/surgery Adolescence is a time when body anxiety is prone to occur, and if school education emphasizes too much on people with body anxiety, ""the soul is in the wrong body."" It may cause anxiety in children and have a negative impact on mental state. However, if an affirmative approach is implemented for adolescents in the developing period and they are encouraged to undergo sex reassignment treatment as soon as possible, it will cause irreparable physical and mental damage if they regret it afterwards. The causes of gender dysphoria are complex and do not necessarily persist into adulthood, and gender reassignment therapy may not resolve gender dysphoria. ※Affirmative approach: Advocates affirming the feelings of transgender children (those who are anxious about their own gender), and letting them change their gender as early as possible, lest they hurt themselves or even commit suicide.

In addition to the criminal liability, the manager of a single space can seek compensation from the offender through civil law on the grounds of damaging goodwill and other reasons. Leave recognizable marks or words on the ID card, such as writing transgender women in the gender column. Changes in the ID card column such as transgender must be recorded in the household registration book. Therefore, refuse to touch or change people (change to biological women) to perform duties. Children under the age of 16 are not allowed to receive hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery. The number of gender-friendly toilets must be enshrined in the law, requiring government agencies, employers, and public facilities to provide at least a minimum gender-friendly toilets (including the number of cubicles) in proportion to the number of people. Area service or establishments that only serve biological women (including but not limited to massage, aromatherapy and hair removal, etc.) personnel have the right to refuse to serve customers of non-original gender.

Why was the competition in the auditorium cancelled?) On 1/28, the Ministry of Education announced the suspension of the team competition; After a year of baptism, the students\' concept of epidemic prevention can only be said to be more mature, and masks in public places are the basics. According to the current level of the epidemic, it is obviously not appropriate to directly announce the suspension before considering the postponement. However, the nearly 300,000 participants mentioned in the news had nothing to do with it. Most groups only stay around the arena for less than a day, and they are divided into multiple arenas (10). It is not 300,000 people crowded into one performance hall, it depends on the average number of people. Groups may come into contact with each other only when entering and exiting the arena. This can be completely avoided by moving line planning. Even now that the epidemic has broken out, all kinds of public transportation are still operating as usual, and I have never heard of crowds caused by taking the same bus/high-speed rail. What\'s more, everyone is from the same school, so they are more aware of their respective physical conditions, and there will be no unknown health status. Last year, as soon as I received the notice of the suspension of the national competition, it hit all the students who got the right to represent.

Now it is just a different venue. From the perspective of whether it is necessary, last year\'s National Games was also postponed. Why did the sports competition go ahead, but the performing arts class was canceled? Although one is indoors and the other is outdoors, the performing arts class has less contact with other schools. Here are some suggestions for your reference: 1. Not open to spectators. 2. The organizer will issue photography certificates to those who have applied for it, or simply record the whole process by the organizer.', 'The national student performing arts competition for the 2019 academic year and the team competition were suspended. Is there any other solution? (I know that someone has proposed, but please don\'t accept it yet)At present, there is already a proposal with the same purpose on the website, and I hope to put forward a more complete idea here (More: I know that the Ministry of Education has stated in the Internet news that there will be no postponement, but I don’t want to spend three days of hard work and end up saving it on the computer↓) (In reply to the Ministry of Education, the news mentioned that the results of the team competition have little effect on the excess score, but in fact the competition score accounts for 12 points of the excess score, without which I may not be able to go to high school) In a classroom, it was not suspended. Why was the competition in the auditorium cancelled?) On 1/28, the Ministry of Education announced the cancellation of the team competition; the news that the competition was on schedule, but there is still more than a month before the competition date, is it too early to announce the cancellation now? After a year of baptism, the students\' concept of epidemic prevention can only be said to be more mature, and masks in public places are the basics. According to the current level of the epidemic, it is obviously not appropriate to directly announce the suspension before considering the postponement. However, the nearly 300,000 participants mentioned in the news had nothing to do with it. Most groups only stay around the arena for less than a day, and they are divided into multiple arenas (10). It is not 300,000 people crowded into one performance hall, it depends on the average number of people. Groups may come into contact with each other only when entering and exiting the arena. This can be completely avoided by moving line planning. Even now that the epidemic has broken out, all kinds of public transportation are still operating as usual, and I have never heard of crowds caused by taking the same bus/high-speed rail. What\'s more, everyone is from the same school, so they are more aware of their respective physical conditions, and there will be no unknown health status. Last year, as soon as I received the notice of the suspension of the national competition, it hit all the students who got the right to represent. After preparing for a whole year, but finally unable to show it on stage, all the results of hard practice were wiped out. At that time, when the epidemic just started, I can still understand. What cheered us up at that time was the hope that we could enter the final again next year, as well as the encouragement from our teachers. However, after another year of hard work by everyone, this year\'s team competition has been suspended again. So why are you practicing so hard? We are not trying to be rejected, and the current epidemic situation is ""not"" as serious as the same period last year. There is a better way besides suspending the event: Postponing the ""COVID-19 (New Coronary Pneumonia)"" Response Guidelines issued by the Epidemic Command Center: Public Gathering It is mentioned that for: 1. Non-essential, 2. Participating activities are not specific objects, 3. The form of activities has a high risk of infection due to intensive contact, it should be evaluated whether to postpone or suspend. Regardless of whether competitions are unnecessary; the participants must be students and teachers from various schools, and they are all specific targets. It can also be compared to the county competitions that do not accept observations, which is safer; as for intensive contact, everyone is usually in the same space for group training.

One person still only has one vote.If you don’t like any candidate, you can choose to oppose someone to be elected. After deducting the negative votes from the affirmative votes, the person with the higher net affirmative votes will be elected. It is not possible to support someone and oppose another candidate. We promote negative votes for three reasons: 1. It should be a basic human right to use ballots to clearly express the free will of approving or opposing a certain candidate. In the last nine-in-one election in Taiwan, 38% of the village chiefs, 2970 people ran equally, and there were no competitors. That is to say, he (she) only needs to vote for himself or herself to be elected. Is there any place in Taiwan where the chief or the representative of the people is a local leader? No one dares to come out to challenge the election? This is a complete democracy. 2. Turnout rate will increase. The poll we commissioned Gallup in July 2015 confirmed that the turnout rate in Taiwan will increase by 5% to 10%. That means 900,000 to 1.8 million more voters will participate! Voting, and some votes are ""tearful votes"" because voters hate another candidate, not really supporting him. Being able to increase turnout without coercion or inducement is a major improvement in a democratic system. 3. The person with the most extreme speech or position is less likely to be elected. Intermediate voters who do not belong to any political party are more likely to vote against it. Because there is only one vote, it can only oppose the most hated ones, so those politicians with the most extreme positions will not be elected. If radical politicians cannot be elected, radical speeches will naturally decrease, the society will be more harmonious internally, and it will be less easy to fight externally. The above 3 points are applicable to any democratic country. There are two other benefits to implement in Taiwan: 4. Reduce subsidy funds and use public funds for other constructions--currently subsidize individual candidates with 30 yuan per vote. The main reason why the blue and green legislators do not support negative votes. They lead the legislation and use our taxpayers’ money to enrich their own pockets. Of course, they must try their best to discredit or block the voices of our small people who oppose these vested interests. 5. Eliminate the vote-buying culture. Illegal vote-buying in Taiwan elections is still rampant.', ""In the same election, the content of the ballot circle should be changed to agree or disagreeReasons Although the current elections in Taiwan have regulations (except for village chiefs) that candidates running for equal quotas must have a certain percentage of votes to be elected, but it is not well known. The spirit of democracy lies in the people's decision-making. Regular elections are used to select talents and talents, rather than through elections to see how local factions are integrated and colluded. However, Taiwan’s current attitude towards equal elections is to use passive “vote percentage” to determine whether a candidate is elected, rather than actively “agree or disagree” to determine the effectiveness of a candidate’s re-election. There is only a column for candidates on the ballot, and there is no column for invalid votes. During the election, the election work has repeatedly publicized the possibility of casting invalid votes. It seems that invalid votes are set as a display that does not conform to civic literacy. , making the candidate lucky enough to be elected. Suggestions for Improvement In addition to the currently standardized threshold for the number of votes to be elected, votes of approval and disapproval are stamped on the ballots for the same amount of elections, and a double standard is used to strictly test whether the candidate meets the conditions for election."", ""Correct the law on the election and recall of public officials to improve the atmosphere of elections in Taiwan and improve the chaos of flags flying in the sky and propaganda everywhereAmended Article 15, Article 40, Article 52, Article 56, etc. of the Law on the Election and Recall of Public Officials (Original) Article 15 A person who has the right to vote and has lived in each electoral district for more than four months shall be an elector for the election of public officials in each electoral district.

Currently there are proposals on ""combating fake news and hate speech, and improving media self-discipline."" The proposal is being seconded. In order to increase the number of seconded proposals, please make more use of them. Therefore, this case will not be seconded. First of all, the main purpose of the proposal again is to remind the government: 1. Taking advantage of the diverse opinions and contradictions of the masses, to spread fake news and hate messages (such as articles or message content of specific groups or individuals), sow dissension and intensify the emotions of the masses, thereby destroying social order and irrational behavior, the degree of harm is higher than false statements that can be seen through at a glance. Especially in an environment where a democratic system is adopted, pluralism, and the management of social platforms are not rigorous, the destructive power is even more astonishing. 2. When the operation of disinformation on the Internet has been successful, clarifying the facts to the people who misbelieve the disinformation is of little help at this time. On the contrary, misbelievers will think that more people should understand the facts they have seen, and may cooperate with spreading or reposting fake news or hate messages to make the problem worse. 3. Same as above, when the operation of online fake news has been successful, if at this time the overseas cyber army is already familiar with the local network ecology, including posting, message norms and management methods of each social platform, as well as popular trends and preferences of each page or group. If we improperly infiltrate and participate in activities, report and participate in the management mechanism of social media platforms, and then allow fake news or hate speech to spread, the harm caused should not be underestimated. Therefore: In order to prevent and aggravate the harm of false information, in addition to legislation to prevent and control false information, establish a foreign agent registration law to prevent foreign information interference. The government sets up an independent agency, or confirms that the competent authority supervises the social platform, and requires the platform operators to abide by the responsibility of self-discipline. The suggestion should be included in the scope of consideration. ================================================================== The number of management scope: a certain scale, profit or non -profit nature, forum and communication platform (hereinafter referred to as community platform). 2. The planning of the supervisory unit imitates the organizational structure of the NCC (National Communications Commission), and the applicable management laws and regulations of the community platform. The content of the laws and regulations includes standardizing the overall planning of enterprises (or non-profit groups), personnel structure, administrative organization, financial planning and internal control management projects, as well as applicable rewards and penalties. The key points are: 1. Compulsory and standardized social platforms to display the location and frequency of users\' posts and messages. 2. Compulsory establishment of reporting mechanism. 3. Mandatory cooperation with third-party non-governmental organizations (fact-checking organizations or relevant volunteers) to assist in the investigation. 4. If a third-party non-governmental organization identifies it as fake news or hate messages, the platform must notify the person who posted or left a message and choose whether to delete the post. If they do not cooperate, the platform operator must forcibly delete the post within 24 hours (or 48 hours). 5. Those who have been determined by a third-party non-governmental organization to have improperly disseminated information that provokes division and hatred, or deliberately disseminated false information to dissuade people who are ineffective, and those who have used deepfake and other difficult-to-identify technologies to spread false information, and have been confirmed by multiple investigations. Not only must the article be deleted within the specified time, but the content of the investigation must be reported to the government for investigation. If the operator mismanages (or does not cooperate), the first counseling improves, repeat offenders or mismanagement is serious, the social platform management personnel must be punished. 6.

It is indeed a diplomatic way to deepen international friendship. However, the number of overseas immigration cases has increased recently, and the foreign epidemic situation is still severe. Considering the different degrees of the epidemic situation in various countries, my country currently does not implement border control, and a certain number of tourists enter the country every day, which is a foreseeable risk. Now, if foreigners are allowed to enter Taiwan for medical treatment again, will the risks mentioned above be increased? We don’t know yet, but we cannot take it lightly in the face of the epidemic. Taiwan’s current various retaliatory tourism and consumption are the result of the joint efforts of the command center and all the people in Taiwan.']"

The appearance of China Airlines is as shown in the attached picture', 'The government of the Republic of China (i.e. the governing authority of Taiwan) should promote and assist China Airlines to change its name to Taiwan Airlines/Formosa AirIt is suggested that Taiwan\'s governing authorities should: Make a policy statement on promoting and assisting China Airlines to change its name to Taiwan Airlines/Formosa Air. Use the board seats and equity held by China Airlines to pass the name change resolution. Prepare a budget to subsidize the cost of name change of China Airlines. Assign the Department of Transportation to assist with issues that may arise with respect to air rights and air agreements. China Airlines is the largest privately-owned airline in Taiwan. It transports tourists and business people from all over the world to and from Taiwan and the rest of the world every day, and actively promotes the beauty of Taiwan around the world. The company is undoubtedly one of Taiwan\'s most recognizable symbols in the world. However, its message to the world is wrong because its name is China Airlines. The name makes any external publicity efforts of the company, including the Los Angeles Rose Parade, which has participated in the award-winning Los Angeles Parade every year for decades, help not Taiwan, but China. In addition, because the English name of the company is very similar to the English name of Air China, the largest state-owned airline of the People\'s Republic of China, Air China has also caused great trouble to overseas business travelers and tourists. The biggest problem with this name is that it makes many people mistakenly believe that ""Taiwan is a part of China."" Therefore, China Airlines should be renamed Taiwan Airlines or Formosa Airlines in order to match the name of Taiwan\'s largest civil airline. Of course, China Airlines is a private company, and the name to be used is not something that Taiwan\'s governing authorities can directly intervene in. However, judging from the company\'s shareholding structure, Taiwan\'s governing authorities hold about 46.1% of the company\'s shares through the China Aviation Business Development Foundation, the Labor Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the National Development Fund of the Executive Yuan, and hold 8 board seats, which undoubtedly has great control and influence on the company. Under such circumstances, it should be feasible and effective for Taiwan’s governing authorities to openly and clearly support, facilitate and assist China Airlines to change its name to Taiwan Airlines or Formosa Airlines. In the face of the regime of the People\'s Republic of China constantly using various means to suppress and limit Taiwan\'s international space, and attempting to forcibly incorporate Taiwan, which does not belong to ""China"" under international law, as a part of China, by means of forceful crossings and tyrannical bows, and to make people around the world mistakenly believe that ""Taiwan is a part of China."" The proposer understands that in the past, the issue of changing the name of China Airlines was rejected by relevant units on the grounds that ""China Airlines is a private company, and the company\'s naming is a matter of independent commercial management."" The proposer agrees with the legal fact that ""China Airlines is a private company, and company naming is a matter of independent business management"". Therefore, this proposal does not appeal to China Airlines to change its name, but instead appeals to Taiwan’s governing authorities to make a policy declaration of “facilitating the name change of China Airlines”, to use the board seats and equity they control to pass a resolution on name change, to subsidize the cost of China Airlines’ name change through the preparation of a special budget, and to have the Ministry of Communications assist in handling issues of aviation rights and external contracts.']"

When the bully is determined to destroy the victim’s career, it threatens not only the victim’s financial income, but also many years of money investment (the house has not been paid off) and the family’s financial problems. For the sake of income, the victim has no choice but to endure until there is a physical and mental problem, and may not be able to escape the entanglement of the bully. Workplace bullying is especially common in closed public and teaching positions. Is it because the victim’s ability to resist pressure is too weak? When the victim complains to the agency, he is usually regarded as a troublemaker. The employer, agency or personnel unit considers many motives and will suppress the matter. They are accomplices of bullying. It is the employer who sets the stage for bullying, allowing the bully to choose a target in order to establish his status in the workplace. Even if the employer knows that the bullying problem exists, he may not be willing to improve, because the bully has gained their trust or advice. The lonely victim had no choice but to fight alone, hearing and seeing colleagues around him, fearing to become the next bullied person, and watching all this with cold eyes.

Appropriately restrict their personal freedom to prevent it from infecting others', 'The provision ""Men who have sex with men should never donate blood"" is discriminatory and should be revised according to medical evidenceIt is the responsibility of the country to provide national safe blood products. How to avoid diseases transmitted by blood transfusion is a very important part. The regulation of ""men who have sex with men should never donate blood"" was mainly caused by the rise of AIDS in the 1980s, and men who have sex with men are also a risk group for blood-borne infectious diseases. Due to the limited testing technology at that time, this mandatory regulation was made in order to maintain the safety of blood products. However, with the advancement of testing technology, in addition to the use of enzyme immunoassays to detect viruses, quite a number of countries currently use nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) to make up for the gap in the window period to further ensure the safety of blood products. The benefits of ""donating blood"" have diminished with the advancement of medical testing technology, and it is a discriminatory practice that violates the human rights of different sexual orientation groups; however, the formulation of national health policies should be based on medical evidence, not ignorance and panic about diseases or racial discrimination. Analysis of the five years after the implementation of this policy, the risk of AIDS transmission due to blood products has not increased. Canada implemented the strategy of ""donate blood for five years"" in 2013, and there is no risk difference between it and the strategy of ""never donate blood"". The paper concluded that the change of strategy does not increase the risk of AIDS transmission through blood products. On the other hand, the permanent prohibition of blood donation strategy may increase the moral hazard of men who have sex with men who conceal this behavior and donate blood. The main reason is that the ""permanent prohibition of blood donation"" is actually a practice based on discrimination. According to a survey by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the strategy of ""no men who have sex with men within a year must donate blood"" can instead achieve a compromise between clinical evidence, blood safety, and human rights issues, and further reduce the moral hazard of ""concealing one\'s sexual behavior for blood donation"". Even if the focus is on all diseases that may be transmitted through blood transfusion, the risk of revising the blood donation strategy is still far less than the risk of blood transfusion medicine. In summary, considering international trends, based on medical evidence and reducing discrimination: ""Those who have had no sex with men for a year are allowed to donate blood""']"

Contact the customer service of the platform, the customer service said that the order cannot be canceled, and if I insist on canceling, I cannot refund. If the meal is left for too long after the meal is finished, certain dishes such as noodles, even if they are not soaked in soup, the taste will inevitably become poor. Seriously affect the feelings of consumers, and even have a bad impression on the store. What is even more worrying is that after the food is cooked and left at room temperature for a long time, bacteria tend to multiply rapidly, which greatly increases the possibility of food poisoning for consumers. If the food delivery platform fails to actively deal with this problem, both consumers and stores will suffer. The design of a delivery platform is that when the store starts to accept orders, if there is no delivery person near the store, consumers will not be able to place an order. This design successfully solves the problem and I think it is the best solution. If the food delivery platform insists that as long as the store can accept the order, consumers are allowed to place an order, regardless of whether the delivery person can be found in time, and a bottom line should be established. For example, 30 minutes after the meal is completed, the platform still cannot find the delivery person. Consumers can cancel the order and receive a refund, and the loss of the store will be borne by the platform. The solutions are not limited to the above two, and relevant government units should urge all food delivery platforms to quickly improve this problem. the', 'Urge the government to enact a special law to protect the right to work of delivery workersIn recent years, the food delivery industry has risen. At present, according to central statistics, there are about 88,000 people working as delivery workers, but it has also caused many controversial issues, such as the contracting or employment relationship between the delivery workers and the delivery platform? The order delivery process of the two platforms is slightly different. The Uber Eats platform partly lies in the fact that after the customer places an order, the platform will first send the order to the restaurant to make the meal, and then match the delivery staff to pick up the meal when the meal preparation time is almost completed. Sometimes, they can take 1-2 orders at a time. Panda sends the order to the delivery staff first, and then sends the order to the store to make the meal after confirming that someone can take the order. Panda also has a problem with the system instructions, that is, the delivery staff can only deliver the food in the order instructed by the system, even if the order is not in the same direction, it cannot be changed. In the beginning, the food delivery platform operators spent money to seize the market, but now they are oligopolistic. The two platforms account for 70% to 80% of the market, and the pricing power is mostly determined by the two platforms. Whether it is a joint price reduction or price increase, the delivery staff can only be forced to accept it, which is a very unfavorable situation. 1. The salary of the delivery staff was arbitrarily lowered. Since the labor status of the delivery staff is only determined on a case-by-case basis under the labor inspection of the Ministry of Labor, the 5 delivery platform operators including Panda and Uber Eats have an ""employment relationship"" with the delivery staff, but the platform will change the contract again, focusing on the contract system. Other ministries such as the Fair Council and the Ministry of Communications cannot be identified either. Therefore, if there is no clear source of legal basis for the rights and interests of the courier involved in the competent authority, not only the flexibility of labor, but also the protection of labor rights will also be flexible, which may cause serious problems. 2. Black-box salary calculation by platform operators. The labor rights of delivery workers are not guaranteed. There was a delivery worker who estimated that his income was more than 25,000 yuan, but was found to be cut to more than 14,000 yuan during the settlement? Currently, the two major food delivery platforms in Taiwan have the problem of black-box salary calculation. Because the platform operators have set a series of requirements for the delivery personnel, among them, the Panda platform requires the delivery personnel to have an order-taking rate of more than 85%, and they cannot refuse the order arbitrarily in order to get the full bonus. If the order acceptance rate is not reached, the bonus will be deducted and only the basic fee will be left, and there will be a salary gap. As a result, the original delivery staff\'s expected salary of 25,000 is 1-2%. 3 Delivery work looks like employment, but the contract is a contract. The relationship between the delivery person and the operator\'s platform is still unclear. What are the pros and cons of both roles? The employment relationship will comply with the ""Labor Standards Act"". The operator must protect the rights and interests of employees, which is relatively inflexible; the contract relationship has flexible working hours, and the delivery staff can do whatever they want.

In recent years, the number of recall cases raised by the people has increased. Relatively speaking, the administrative costs of recall-related matters handled by the central and local election authorities have also gradually increased. Although the right to recall is a basic right guaranteed by Chapter 12 of the Constitution, the meaning of recall is to eliminate ineligible public officials, not as a means of retaliation or deliberately leading the people to eliminate political opponents. When political interest units or organizations excessively apply for or guide a large number of recall cases, the original intention of weeding out ineligible public officials has been lost. It has come close to inciting the people to eliminate political opponents in the name of elimination. Recall fees are also tax revenues, and recall votes are not repetitive and only target a single ineligible public official, so the funds for recall are often extra-budgetary expenditures. Therefore, in order to ensure that the current recall vote can be used to eliminate incompetent public officials, and to avoid excessive or inappropriate applications for recalls causing waste of public funds. Suggestions: 1. It is recommended that the competent authority for recall and election should review the letter of reasons for dismissal of public officials submitted by the leader of the recall to ensure that the reasons for dismissal correspond to the contents of the dismissed person’s duties and should be justified, rather than ideological reasons. 2. In order to respect the opinions of the majority of voters in the electoral district, ensure that the recall case is not the opinion of only a few people (although the joint signatures of the recall have reached the standard, it is still necessary to confirm whether the public official is removed by voting), and also ensure that the position of agreeing to recall accounts for a certain proportion of the electoral district, so as to avoid wasting public funds on unnecessary recall cases. Therefore, it is suggested that: (1) If the total number of recall votes does not reach a certain percentage, the leader of the recall case must pay part of the administrative fee within a certain period of time after the announcement of the recall vote result. (2) If the number of people who agree to recall does not reach a certain percentage, the leader of the recall case must pay part of the administrative fee within a certain period of time after the announcement of the recall voting result. ※Similar to the election deposit system, the deposit will be forfeited if the number of votes does not reach a certain percentage. (Elections are collected in advance, while recalls are collected afterwards). 3. The competent authority should monitor whether there is any false news in the publicity content of both parties in the recall case, or the publicity content should be related to the job content of the public official (for example: the person to be recalled is a local public official, but the leader/organization publicizes the recall based on the lack of job content of the central government official as the recalled person). If both parties to the recall case or the general public mislead voters, they should be clearly punished. Safeguard the rights of both parties in the recall case.']"

Students who are already working have encountered some problems.

However, why is a person with full capacity for conduct in civil law 20 years old? After the age of 18, you should bear heavy responsibilities, but you cannot enjoy the rights you should have as an adult. In addition, many acts related to the rights and obligations of people with limited capacity in civil law (such as opening an account, applying for a door number, labor contract, etc.) require the consent of a legal representative. In addition to increasing the troubles of studying and working in other places, it also gives parents the right to restrict their children's freedom. Therefore, it should be revised"", 'Advocate to revise the ""Civil Law"" and adjust the age limit for ""persons with capacity for conduct"" to 18 years old, so that young people in Beiyi have equal rights and responsibilities, connect with the world, and return rights to young people.Theme: To amend the outdated laws that imprisoned the autonomy and creativity of 18-year-old youths. This case advocates the revision of the ""Civil Law"" and lowers the age limit for ""persons with capacity for conduct"" to 18 years old. The rights, obligations, and responsibilities of humble young people are equal, and they are in line with the world to embrace the world and return rights to young people. Amendment of Articles 12 and 13 of the Civil Code, etc., and other related provisions. Explanation: 1. Due to inconsistent laws and regulations, the rights of young people are empty. There are currently 578,000 ""semi-adults"" between the ages of 18 and 20 in Taiwan. ""Semi-adults"" have the right to use public votes to participate in the decision of major national policies, and they must bear full criminal responsibility if they commit a crime. However, because they are under 20 years old, they are still considered minors in the ""Civil Law"". 2. It is the trend of the world to become an adult at the age of 18. Nowadays, with the development of network technology and the increasing popularity of mass media, the learning of knowledge and skills for young people is no longer limited to school education. With the flow of massive information, the ability to construct self-awareness is gradually enhanced. European countries successively completed the revision of the law in the 1970s. The United Kingdom amended the Family Law in 1969, lowering the age of majority from 21 to 18; France, after the adoption of Act No. 74-631 on July 5, 1974, which stipulated that 18 years of age was an adult, also amended Article 388 of the Civil Code to ""minors refer to individuals under the age of 18""; Germany amended Article 2 of the Civil Code in 1974, reducing the age of adulthood from 21 to 18. Even Japan, which has a relatively conservative social atmosphere, revised the 146-year-old ""Civil Code"" last year to reduce the age of majority to 18 years old, which will be officially implemented in 2022. After Japan amended the law, more than 130 laws had to be adjusted accordingly, but the Japanese government actively launched supporting measures to seek social support. For example, in recent years, the number of cases of defrauding young people has increased, and the Japanese government has announced the revision of the Consumer Contract Law, allowing victims aged 18 to 20 to cancel relevant contracts. 3. The current law was enacted 90 years ago and does not meet current social needs. Article 12 of the current Civil Law stipulates that a person is an adult at the age of 20. Article 13 stipulates that minors under the age of 7 have no capacity for conduct. After getting married at the age of 18, they will be regarded as persons with full capacity in civil law. The ""Civil Law"" was enacted in 1929. The age standard is to prevent minors from being deceived due to insufficient judgment or shouldering responsibilities that they cannot bear. However, 90 years ago, the space-time environment set ""adulthood"" as 20 years old, so that the current minors need to obtain the consent of their legal representatives to open bank accounts, purchase insurance, sign contracts and other legal acts, which does not meet the current social needs. 4. The Ninth Establishment Committee expressed its support for ""lowering the voting age."" The Legislative Yuan amended the ""Referendum Law"" in 2017, lowering the referendum age to 18 years old to encourage young people to participate in public affairs; in 2015, it discussed a constitutional amendment to give 18-year-old youth the right to vote, and all major political parties expressed their support. According to the results of last year\'s ""Today Weekly"" interview with all legislators, as many as 93% of the 64 interviewed legislators expressed their support for ""lowering the voting age."" 5. The civil law for adults at the age of 20 imprisoned the autonomy, creativity and entrepreneurial ability of 18-year-old youth. Palmer Luckey, a representative of American VR (virtual reality) technology, started designing VR headsets at the age of 16. At the age of 19, he raised 2.4 million US dollars from the public and founded the VR company Oculus. In 2014, at the age of 21, he sold the company to Facebook for $2 billion. In Taiwan, Tang Feng, the current political affairs member of the Executive Yuan, also started an Internet company when he was 16 years old. However, because the ""Company Law"" refers to the ""Civil Law"", it stipulates that ""persons without capacity"" under the age of 7 and ""persons with limited capacity"" between the ages of 7 and 20 are not allowed to serve as company managers, promoters and directors of joint stock companies. Tang Feng, who was underage at the time, could only appoint a family member as the person in charge of the company, and then participate in decision-making as an employee. 6. The 20 ban on electronic payments is also restricted. Taiwan\'s ""Civil Law"" restrictions on minors are not limited to entrepreneurship. In April of this year, the electronic payment institution ""Jiekou Payment"" was corrected by the Financial Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan due to a system setting error that allowed more than a thousand people under the age of 20 to open accounts without the consent of their legal representatives. Although legislators suggested that the electronic payment account limit is only 30,000 yuan, and that 18-year-olds can open accounts by themselves; however, Gu Lixiong, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, responded that before the age limit for ""persons with legal capacity"" in the ""Civil Law"" has not been lowered to 18 years old, legality is still controversial.']"

In prisons and schools, rules that violate religious teachings must not be established."", 'Opposition to the ""Draft of the Religious Organization Law of the Republic of China 106th Edition of the Executive Yuan""1. The draft is unconstitutional, with the purpose of controlling and preventing corruption: Article 13 of the Constitution of the Republic of China clearly stipulates: ""The people have the freedom of religious belief."" On February 27, 1993, the Council of Justices made an interpretation No. 573 on this: ""(Government) religious norms, if they are not necessary for the maintenance of religious freedom or for major public interests, and if they are done to the minimum necessary, they are contrary to the constitution\'s intention to protect people\'s freedom of belief!"" It can be seen that unless the religious belief behavior of groups or individuals clearly violates major public interests or hinders the religious freedom of others, the government will use ""hypothetical"" thinking such as ""preventing religious chaos"" to legislate on religion and take various control and supervision measures in advance, which violates the religious freedom guaranteed by Article 13 of the Constitution and constitutes unconstitutional! 2. Rough drafting procedures and processes, lack of credibility: Religious legislation involves people\'s beliefs and attitudes and the development of the country\'s religion, so careful drafting is required! However, the drafting procedure of the Political Yuan version is relatively rough and incomplete. The religious representatives selected privately by the administrative department lack a public selection process, which makes it hard to believe that they have the objective and professional ability to take a comprehensive view of religious matters and needs. In particular, they lack constitutional professionals to conduct constitutional checks on the draft, resulting in most of the draft provisions being unconstitutional. 3. The lack of clear conditions and arguments for necessary legislation does not conform to the principle of proportionality: Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes...the freedom to express his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, individually or collectively, in public or in secret. The current government enacted the Law on Religious Organizations on the grounds of the so-called ""response to the proposals from all walks of life to promote legislative regulation of religious groups."" However, the government\'s imposition of uniform organizational regulations on religious groups not only violates the spirit of ""respecting the principle of autonomy and self-discipline of religious organizations,"" but also goes beyond the limit of ""religious norms should be carried out to the minimum necessary"" as explained in Interpretation No. 573 of Interpretation Zi. 4. The objection is to defend the core value of democratic development: Today, religious figures from all walks of life come out to oppose the government\'s inappropriate religious laws. Their focus is to protect the human rights of all people and the free development of religious beliefs. This is also an important core value of Taiwan\'s long-term democratic development! It is definitely not just for the self-interest of each religion. People from all walks of life should be able to understand the intentions of various religious circles on this matter. Initiators of the petition: Taiwan Buddhist Federation, Chinese Buddhist Bhikkhuni Association, Chinese Buddhist Association, Chinese Buddhist Monk Association (unranked, increasing continuously).', ""Re-examine the relevant regulations on tax exemption for religious groups and engaging in public welfare and charitable activities, and implement religious freedom.People have the freedom of assembly, association and religious belief. According to current regulations, people can apply to form a religious group and enjoy certain preferential tax reductions and exemptions related to the Income Tax Law, Business Tax Law, Real Estate Tax Law, Inheritance and Gift Tax Law, and Transaction Tax Law. In recent years, some religious groups have used the name of religious activities to carry out property purchases and political activities, departing from the purpose of the establishment of religious groups, avoiding the need for permission to raise funds for unspecified people through the relevant regulations of the Public Welfare Solicitation Regulations. This case does not claim that religious groups evade the law by raising funds, fundraising, or covertly serve politics under the guise of religion, but that there are obvious deficiencies in Taiwan's domestic regulations on religious groups. The following four points are suggested in this case: 1. Strict regulations should be imposed on religious groups engaging in political activities. Reason: Although the Constitution stipulates that religious freedom is the basic right of the people, the practice of religious freedom is the negative freedom of the people and belongs to the right to resist external interference. Religious teachings must not be used as an excuse to interfere or infringe on the basic rights and substantive interests of others. 2. Religious groups are required to obtain third-party financial and taxation visas to facilitate public accountability and be responsible to donors and the general public. Reason: Regarding the financial situation of religious groups, except for the internal contractors and managers (directors) and supervisors handled by them, the rest of the public information is insufficient. It is difficult to find out whether there are funds that have not been misused, embezzled or violated the purpose of the establishment of the articles of association. 3. To restrict religious groups from directly engaging in charitable, cultural, educational, and social welfare undertakings, separate organizations such as public welfare associations or social charitable foundations should be established and handed over to the competent authorities for supervision. Reason: Although religious groups are non-profit organizations, considering the separation of church and state, religious freedom, religious tolerance, and the highly professional nature of social welfare work, it is not appropriate for religious groups to directly engage in the above-mentioned public welfare and charitable activities, and religious groups often have the risk of affecting or even infringing on the basic rights of others through the above-mentioned activities. Therefore, it is suggested that religious groups should entrust social welfare institutions, organizations or personnel with professional backgrounds, and use legal trust units as third-party auditing units, so as to prevent religious teachings from interfering with professional public welfare and charitable activities. For the dissemination and practice of their teachings, religious groups should set up religious education colleges or other similar institutions, and limit them to only handle business related to their religious education activities. 4. Cancel the tax exemption regulations for religious groups. Except for donations and trust related expenses related to public welfare organizations, the rest of the income and fruits should be directly tax-deducted and calculated at an increased tax rate. Reason: The social resources obtained by religious groups are of no real help to the country, and have a crowding out effect on the resource collection and distribution of other social welfare charitable organizations. However, the government often still has to maintain the freedom of religion, assembly and association of religious groups and their members through various infrastructure construction and resource investment. Therefore, the government should tax them more heavily to prevent religious groups from using public resources without taxation and free riding.""]"

The basic salary of the working population should not be handled by both parties (labor representatives) and (management representatives) in the meeting room, representing the management to deal with procedural issues, eating lunch at the meeting, and bargaining, just like a car accident. That's right, the current minimum basic salary is bridged by the above method. The basic salary of labor and the working environment should be based on the fruits of labor that workers can enjoy, and the working environment must not cause irreparable damage to the life and body of the working population. The minimum basic wage requirement is to maintain the working population below the minimum working limit, and the results earned can sustain survival. Therefore, I propose to combine the basic salary with the right to survival to completely improve this false fight economy and Joe thing. The basic right to survival, human beings are creatures, Feng Qi must metabolize, grow, reproduce, exercise, and sense throughout his life, and must give natural people enough living space, food, drinking water, transportation, social interaction, clothing, and leisure to achieve. Therefore, the basic salary should be based on the personal needs of the above expenses, and formulate it as the minimum salary standard.

In contrast, the current basic salary = food expenses + commuting expenses + basic water, electricity, gas and network expenses insurance. The working environment has been bad for a long time, and young people have no hope. Going abroad to work as a Taiwanese prostitute has become the main plan for realizing their dreams. Therefore, I propose that the basic salary should ensure that workers can buy a 10-ping apartment within 5 years as one of the criteria, which can provide young people with the opportunity to reproduce. If two people live in a 15-ping apartment, they can easily form a family. In addition, the working environment must be improved. The maximum working hours per week is 40 hours. If they want to work overtime, the overtime workers must hold more than 1% of the shares of the labor unit before they can work overtime.

As for whether to continue to relax, considering the current level of mild visual impairment in China, it is already looser than other advanced countries. With one eye completely blind and the other eye normal, the effective vision rate is 80%. Based on the use of limited welfare resources and the principle of fairness, it is still decided not to be included."" , if the other eye is above 0.4, it does not belong to the scope of physical and mental disabilities, and this department can only handle it in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations.

As for whether to continue to relax, considering the current level of mild visual impairment in China, it is already looser than other advanced countries. With one eye completely blind and the other eye normal, the effective vision rate is 80%. Based on the use of limited welfare resources and the principle of fairness, it is still decided not to be included."" , if the other eye is above 0.4, it does not belong to the scope of physical and mental disabilities, and this department can only handle it in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations. ""With the loss of monocular vision, how to maintain the effective function of vision at 80% is contrary to the normal rule of thumb. Moreover, the obstacles in life caused by blindness in one eye are by no means mild and indescribable. People with one eye have deviations in their vision of orientation, distance, and three-dimensionality. Although the field of vision may meet the standard, it is still narrower than that of people with two eyes. There are often blind spots in vision. I often bump into and fall when I walk; it is inconvenient to drive a vehicle; I can’t hold objects stably due to gaps in picking up and landing; I lose confidence psychologically and thus alienate from society; Such things cannot be identified by instruments, but they always cause a lot of inconvenience and troubles in the daily life of monocular people. Suggested methods: (1). The deficiencies under the category of visual impairment should be supplemented and relaxed according to law: it should be recognized that blindness in one eye is visual impairment. The light, moderate, and severe cases of hair and disability are classified according to the visual acuity of the good eye. (2) The medical judgment made by the doctor should be respected. If the doctor recognizes that blindness in one eye is a clear physical disability, and there is a situation that causes life support, the government agency should respect the professional hair and the handbook of physical and mental disabilities. Monocular blindness is visual impairment. The social system should face up to this fact, stop systematically discriminating against monocular visually impaired people, and have the obligation to give them natural assistance.']"

For example: Apple Daily’s Kaohsiung passenger transport illegal schedule in October this year. , violated the ""Labor Standards Act"", and the Kaohsiung Passenger Transport was a repeat offender, but the Kaohsiung Labor Bureau fined him 40,000 yuan. Quote: Kaohsiung Passenger Transport illegally schedules shifts, drives tired and stops on the side of the road. As for why companies in Taiwan are not afraid of labor laws? The main reason is that Taiwan’s labor inspectors are insufficient and penalties are too low, because labor inspections will have a SOP process. After the first-line inspection, the results will be thrown on the labor cloud platform for recording. Bet, you don’t have to be afraid to pay 30,000 yuan once you come back after a long time. After two or three months, the boss will make another fortune. Paying 30,000 yuan is no different from paying a protection fee. Quote: Why the boss doesn’t abandon the Labor Standards Law? The labor inspector points out the key reasons. For example: Please think about it, why is Taiwan’s drink driving regulation so strict, and some people still dare to drive after drinking? Because people who drink will gamble, how could I be so unlucky that I will encounter the police inspection!!

The head of the labor inspection unit is open to direct election or selection of workers. The calculation of compensatory leave shall be equivalent to the double calculation method of overtime pay.Controversy over the revision of the Labor Standards Act has continued recently. Less than a year after the new law was implemented, the ruling party wants to revise the Labor Standards Law again, but its position is completely different from the last time, and the restrictions on capital are greatly relaxed. In order to reflect and reward the Ministry of Labor for such drastic changes within a year, three proposals have been made. 1. The Ministry of Labor has changed its name to ""Ministry of Capital and Labor"" in recognition of its recent speeches and highlighting its core values. Regarding the controversy over the revision of the law, the Ministry of Labor has taken different positions within just one year. The same minister originally insisted that the current law is in the right direction and does not need to be amended. . The Labor Standards Act should be the most basic labor protection for workers, and the Ministry of Labor should be the highest administrative agency to protect labor safety. However, in the face of this hasty revision of the law, the Ministry of Labor has been unable to produce relevant research reports and data ""after the revision"". Labor scholars from all walks of life, members of the Law Committee of the Ministry of Labor, legislators, labor unions, and grassroots workers have been questioned about turning exceptions into general rules and treating general rules as exceptions. The Ministry of Labor has always said that ""it is necessary to give flexibility to the management"", ""it is impossible to report to you which industries have demand"" and other vague responses. This time, the Ministry of Labor demonstrated the law amendment hairpin turn for the people of the whole country. It is a typical top-to-bottom (Executive Director to the Minister of Labor), capital to labor, the boss orders the subordinates, and the subordinates cannot resist. Therefore, it is suggested that the Ministry of Labor be renamed the Ministry of Resources and Labor, so that it will be famous forever. 2. In order to be considerate of the management, the calculation method for overtime compensation should be calculated according to the multiple of overtime pay, so as to help the boss save water and electricity bills. Taiwan’s wages are too low, the working hours are too long, and labor conditions are not equal to negotiation between labor and management. In order to sympathize with the operating difficulties of Taiwan’s employers who often do not have enough funds to pay overtime pay according to law, we appeal again: the calculation method for compensatory leave for overtime work should be handled in the same way as the calculation method for extended working hours (multiply by 1.33, 1.66, etc.), rather than one-to-one calculation of unequal value. This move is not only fairer to the labor side, but also increases the reasonable number of compensatory days off for employees without going to the company, and can also help the employer save the company\'s utility bills. Such accumulation can make Taiwanese bosses more competitive and reduce the psychological burden of insufficient funds. 2. Referring to the appointment model of Lai Xiangling, the director of the Labor Bureau of Taipei City, the appointment and removal of the labor chiefs of the central ministries and committees is handled by the labor voting and selection model. If the labor chiefs, especially the labor inspection or labor safety units, have a basis of public opinion, they will have room to conduct ""reciprocal"" negotiations with their superiors instead of just doing meritorious deeds. Lai Xiangling, the director of the Taipei City Labor Bureau, is the best example. Therefore, the heads of labor inspection units and related agencies should allow workers (those with labor insurance qualifications) to vote and then select them, so as to represent the voice of workers and be responsible to workers. (You can refer to Lai Xiangling, Director of the Labor Bureau of Taipei City, at the beginning of the I-VOTING universal selection mechanism). [Repeat my three proposals] In recognition of the performance of the Ministry of Labor\'s amendment to the law, the Ministry of Labor was renamed the Ministry of Resources and Labor, and the name of the Ministry of Labor was encouraged and immortalized forever. The calculation method of overtime for compensatory leave should be calculated according to the calculation method of extended working hours (multiplied by 1.33, 1.66, etc.), instead of one-to-one calculation of unequal value, to help employers save water and electricity bills. The heads of labor inspection units and related agencies should be selected after open labor voting, so as to represent the voice of labor and be responsible to labor.

The total income tax payable may be lower than that of the joint declaration. However, according to the current tax reporting mechanism, there is no standard for separate declarations, and most ordinary people do not know how to fight for their own rights and interests, so they can only let the tax authorities deduct more taxes. According to Interpretation No. 318 of the Supreme Judge of the Judicial Yuan: ""When taxation is consolidated, if the taxpayer and the spouse and other dependent relatives who have income are calculated jointly, the tax burden will be increased compared with the tax calculated separately, which is inconsistent with the principle of fairness in taxation."" Moreover, our country\'s civil law is also mostly based on individualism and liberalism. Why does the tax law stipulate that husband and wife ""should"" file joint income tax returns? Although it is said that ""a bad law is also a law"", the tax authorities ignore the unconstitutional norms and passively do not revise the norms.

The patterns on banknotes and coins should be changed to Taiwan\'s landscape and culture, or people who have great significance or contributions to the land of Taiwan. Take the 100 yuan banknote as an example. Mr. Sun Yat-sen has very little relationship with Taiwan, and it has no great significance to the area where the New Taiwan dollar is currently used. It would be more appropriate to change it to other patterns that have great contributions to Taiwan or the beautiful scenery of Taiwan. Many countries print their country\'s scenery or characteristics on their banknotes or banknotes. For example, the European Union countries engrave their country\'s characteristic indicators on their coins. For foreign tourists, the banknotes and coins are more valuable for collection.

Later, because the cost was too high, she changed to NT$10, but there was no limit to eat. Originally, she set up a stall near the Pier-2 Warehouse, but later changed it to next to the park land bridge at the intersection of Gongyuan 2nd Road, Yancheng District, and sold it for half a century. Although the buffet price is ten yuan, in addition to large bowls of rice and fish soup, there are also two or three side dishes such as fried fish, boiled meat, and vegetables. Some people live in poverty and have no money, so she provides them for free[2]. She pushes the stroller to the vegetable market every day, and buys vegetables carefully and carefully, but the vegetable sellers know that she is in a loss-making business, so they usually share in the price and weight. In addition to food, she also sells alcohol and tobacco to workers [4]. Because she always sells at a loss, Zhuang Zhuyunnv picks up recycling money for subsidies when she is free, and picks up wood for firewood. However, he was still unable to make ends meet. He sold seven houses to pay off the debts. Afterwards, the eldest son Zhuang Jixiong, who opened a shipping company and a travel agency, decided to bear all the expenses on his shoulders[5]. When word of her good deeds spread, homeless people and the poor nearby came to enjoy the loving buffet. The family members felt sorry for the nearly 80-year-old Zhuang Zhuyun who was still setting up a stall at the time, but she said, ""If I don\'t sell it, what will the workers do? Where are they going to eat?"" The family had to compromise and asked her to only serve lunch instead of serving three meals[2]. Zhuang Zhuyunv was once interviewed by Xu Xiaoshun\'s ""Story in Taiwan"" and Wu Nianzhen\'s ""Taiwan\'s True Love"" and other programs [3]. At that time, the film of Xu Xiaoshun\'s tearful interview was still reposted by netizens for many years [5]. A male vegetable seller told Wu Nianzhen and others: ""Grandma once had cataract surgery on her left eye, and she took a rest for a while, and then she started selling buffets again! When grandma was resting, at noon, there would be a group of people wandering around her restaurant without giving up."" [3] Since 2000, Zhuang Zhuyunu lived at home for five years due to a minor stroke to treat the stroke. Although she recovered, she had to stop selling rice due to her advanced age [6]. On February 13, 2015, Zhuang Zhu Yunv passed away at her home in Yancheng District, Kaohsiung City. Flower baskets and wreaths from all walks of life filled the entire street. The etiquette master told the reporter that some people went to Nianxiang in the early morning of the farewell ceremony, and some strangers wept in the mourning hall as if they had lost their loved ones. I have never seen so many people go to the funeral of ordinary people to pay their respects. Until the funeral, the etiquette agency counted more than 3,000 participants. [6] The eldest son applied to the Kaohsiung City Government to establish the ""Zhuang Zhu Yunv Charity Association"" to continue the mother\'s spirit of charity [6]. Both Yao Wenzhi and James Soong successively suggested that the ten yuan coin should be printed on Zhuang Zhu Yunv[7][8].

Her parents, both market hawkers who made a living selling vegetables, had four sons (including her brother) and two daughters. At the age of 7, she moved to Taitung with her father. After Taitung City Central Market graduated from Taitung Township Renai Elementary School (now Taitung County Renai Elementary School, referred to as Renai Elementary School), her mother suffered a dystocia and was unable to raise enough security money for the hospital, so she died along with the fetus in the womb during the process of sending her to the hospital. Since then, Chen Shuju had no choice but to support the family\'s livelihood, and started selling vegetables at the vegetable stand rented by her mother in the Taitung Central Market to help her elder brother in his studies and raise his younger siblings. Selling Vegetables and Charity In 1969, her third brother was seriously ill due to influenza; at this time, Renai Elementary School initiated a donation to help him receive treatment in the hospital, but there was still no way to recover. Later, her second brother died in a car accident. Feeling bitter and resentful, she devoted more time and effort to selling vegetables, and converted to Haishan Temple to let go of her troubles through the power of Buddhist belief. Since then, she has continued to donate the income from selling vegetables and social welfare undertakings for many years; however, she has also been questioned by her father. In 1993, after her father died of illness, she donated NT$1 million to Fo Guang Academy, which was still under preparation. As a Buddhist, she is a vegetarian and usually saves money on food and expenses, but she is willing to donate money. She was once questioned by her father. In 1997, she donated another NT$1 million to her alma mater, Renai Elementary School, to set up an emergency relief scholarship to repay the help she received many years ago. In 2005, she donated NT$4.5 million to her alma mater, Renai Elementary School, to build a library. In addition, she adopted three orphanage children in the local ""Anishaf Children\'s Home"" and donated NT$1 million, and regularly donated NT$36,000 every year. She once stated that her savings goal is NT$10 million to set up a foundation to help the poor meet their basic living needs. Discovery and Banquet In 2010, Chen Shuju was discovered by overseas media and became famous. ""Time"" magazine even invited her to attend the awards dinner. Under the urging and instructions of the President of the Republic of China Ma Ying-jeou and others, the relevant leaders mobilized to accompany and assist Chen Shuju to go to the United States for a banquet. On May 2, 2010, Taitung County Mayor Huang Jianting accompanied her to take the plane to Taipei. Foreign Minister Yang Jintian personally picked her up at Songshan Airport and assisted her in handling passport affairs. Ma Ying-jeou even took a photo with her at the Presidential Palace after the passport affairs were completed. On May 3, accompanied by Chen Shuju, went to the American Institute in Taiwan at 7:30 to handle the visa affairs; the affairs were completed within 30 minutes. At 18:50 on May 3, Chen Shuju took a plane to the United States accompanied by a female secretary sent by the North American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At 9:40 on May 4th, Chen Shuju and his party arrived in New York and were accompanied by Wei Huanzhong, the head of the New York-Taipei Economic and Cultural Affairs Office, to visit the local vegetable market. In the evening, Chen Shuju and his party took a special car to the Time Warner Center in midtown Manhattan to attend the Time Magazine Top 100 Influential People Dinner.

Of course, the safety of taxis is also regulated to a considerable extent. Take Toyota ALTIS, which has the most domestically-produced cars, as an example.

It is easy to turn the election of a legislator into a populist, and even if he wants to be removed after taking office. Therefore, I believe that the conditions for electors of legislators should be increased, and a more complete supervision mechanism should be established to curb the chaos in the Congress, achieve precise deliberations, and seek the greatest welfare of the country and the people. First of all, I think that when registering for the election of legislators, and when a political party nominates a list of non-regional legislators, it is necessary to pass a special examination formulated by the state, including the rules of procedure, the work of each member, the knowledge of the law, etc., to ensure that legislators understand their powers and basic work. Secondly, set up an independent assessment agency for legislators in the Judicial Yuan. The Judiciary Yuan is a more objective third-party institution. It will restrict the inappropriate words and actions of legislators during the deliberations, and directly admonish or dismiss legislators when they behave inappropriately. The Judiciary Yuan is a more objective third-party organization. It is similar to the congressional supervision alliance but has coercive power.

There is also a case where I myself was not responsible, but the other party was injured and was sued for negligent injury or negligent death. It was too late to ask the person responsible for the accident for repairs, so I had to ask for a settlement before withdrawing the lawsuit. Is this quite unsuitable? You can find a lot of related news by searching the Internet. It is obvious that someone else ran a red light and hit your car, but you were sued for negligent injury and asked for a settlement.

However, as long as there is no personal injury or malicious collision damage to your car in the current regulations, mediation and coordination will fail, and then you can only go to civil affairs, especially when the other party has no insurance (and there are not a few of them). But even if you win the civil case, as long as the other party is messed up, says he has no money, disappears maliciously, changes his mobile phone and does not contact, quits production ""immediately"" after the mediation fails, and asks for money without dying, so that the victim cannot get the compensation he deserves. Isn\'t this behavior considered ""intentional""? The solution but the compensation is a situation where the installment payment has not been paid and the situation is ruined. There is no money because (civil affairs are not enforceable), so unless you apply for compulsory enforcement, the other party can <don’t dump you> anyway, it’s not painful, but you have no money but go out to spend a lot of time + live a normal life. In particular, drunk driving causes a lot of losses in other people’s lives and money and property every year, but the perpetrators have no influence on the strange ecology. It really needs to be changed. It’s not that people are fine if they have nothing to do. Cars are a must-have tool for modern people. In order to preserve the actual situation, cars cannot be repaired immediately, but there are many industries that cannot do without this kind of transportation tool. Do you have to let them swallow the matter and pay for the car repair + the day and all subsequent losses? And the injured party must be treated equally!', 'Car Accident Litigation Prohibits Judges from Sentences and ConvictionsIn view of the current car accident cases, there are no drivers of automobiles and motorcycles who violated traffic regulations. After other drivers of automobiles, motorcycles, bicycles, etc. violated traffic regulations and pedestrians caused accidents due to violations, no drivers of automobiles and motorcycles who violated regulations failed to react and caused subsequent collisions, rolling, or other unexpected and avoidable secondary injuries. It is unjust that judges usually judge innocent driving to be liable for compensation on the grounds that they “did to pay attention and failed to pay attention”. In addition, innocent drivers face a huge amount of subsequent compensation, which makes family life difficult; and this kind of judgment has already fueled the behavior of interested people in the society to seek high compensation through fake car accidents and real lawsuits. Therefore, it is suggested that in the case of a traffic accident lawsuit, the judge\'s assessment of sentencing and conviction should return to 1. Is there a violation of traffic regulations? Such as drunk driving, unlicensed driving, speeding, running red and yellow lights, illegal turning or turning, illegal parking, and other violations of safe driving, road use or walking. 2. At the time of the accident, who owns the priority right of way? 3. Attribution of priority right of way? For example, whether to give way to ambulance, disaster relief, or other vehicles that should have the right of way according to other regulations. 4. Have you committed any other acts that may be regarded as violations of traffic regulations? Those who violate the above-mentioned laws and regulations, and those who cause accidents due to this, shall bear full responsibility. Those who do not violate the aforementioned regulations, but are forced to be involved in the accident (forced perpetrators), shall not bear any criminal or civil responsibility. And the perpetrators who violate the aforementioned laws and regulations shall not claim criminal, civil and compensation liabilities from other forced perpetrators. Victims affected by the accident can only seek criminal, civil liability and compensation against the perpetrator who violated traffic regulations. Nor should the trial judge decide that the innocent forced perpetrator must bear part or all of the criminal, civil liability and compensation on the grounds that ""he should have paid attention but failed to pay attention.""']"

Farmers can apply freely, and relevant units will review and evaluate the agricultural knowledge and practical experience of the applicants. Those who meet the qualifications will be hired without going through the traditional examination mode. Article 9 of the Law on the Protection of Civil Servants does not apply, and must be assessed once a year. Farmers who join the public service system (hereinafter referred to as public farmers) are not included in public insurance, but can be included in agricultural insurance, which is not restricted by the current agricultural insurance qualification review method. It is suggested that the state provide a whip-style agricultural service for official farmers. The crops harvested by official farmers must be fully owned by the state, and the government will instruct local agricultural and food units to build professional storage systems for effective management. Cultivated planting area, the minimum area unit can be set at 0.1 hectare in the initial stage (especially for landowners who own farmland but have been neglected for many years, and the younger generation can be encouraged to resume farming), and then gradually adjusted depending on the results and land planning policies. The salary grades of official farmers can be considered as the basis for the initial calculation of salary according to the size of the actual cultivated planting area. The annual assessment mechanism for public farmers should be presented reasonably, and the numbers should not be overstated and become impediments.

Therefore, emotional problems are often encountered in life, such as emotional blackmail among family members or friends, mental abuse by horrific lovers, and situations of being unable to handle emotions and collapse when they are hit hard. This situation continues to increase in society. Implementing this education in the lives of people (homes and schools) and the lives of adults (workplaces and community centers) can reduce social costs and create better life value. The following are my suggestions: 1. Advocate the family to let the child grow up happily when he is young, so that the child can have a healthy mind in his childhood. 2. Compulsory national high schools and primary schools to increase self-awareness and emotion courses. Elementary school uses games or stories to teach children to recognize various emotions, and also teaches them to respect and empathize with others; junior high school explores self-characteristics, understands themselves, and teaches them what is emotional blackmail and how to avoid it; for high school, I suggest that students understand the characteristics of a horrible lover and learn how to protect themselves from being hurt. 3. Regularly publicize self-knowledge courses in the community, so that everyone can accept themselves and be kind and respectful to others. 4. Increase the frequency of publicity when major accidents occur (fires, earthquakes, etc.), and teach the public to calm their restless hearts. 5. Regardless of whether it is self-awareness promotion or emotional management promotion, the community should hold it once every two months, and the public should be required to participate at least four times a year to strengthen the public’s correct understanding of emotions; the school should hold different types of promotional activities once a month, such as expressing emotions, knowing one’s own emotions, how to comfort and accompany those who are sad, how to distinguish between scary lovers and coping methods, etc., to increase students’ awareness of emotions. 6.

The ""relaxation of payment for new immune drugs"" is the foreseeable future and the hope that cancer patients hope for!Launch background Cancer immune new drug (cancer immune checkpoint inhibitor) is a new type of cancer treatment. The mechanism is to use drugs to enhance the ability of the human immune system to recognize cancer cells, so that immune cells can effectively attack cancer cells, thereby achieving the purpose of eliminating cancer focus or inhibiting its spread. Compared with traditional therapy, the burden and damage to the human body during the course of treatment are lower. However, because new cancer immune drugs stimulate the immune system of cancer patients to play a role, if the patient\'s own immune system is deficient or the drug is administered too late, it is difficult for the patient\'s poor physical condition to exert the expected clinical effect. Since the 2010 Republic of China, new cancer immune drugs have been approved by the National Health Insurance for 8 cancer types and 11 indications to be covered, which has been recognized by the majority of Chinese people. However, according to the statistics of the National Health Insurance Administration, under the current budget constraints, the actual number of approved users is only less than 2,000 (1,838 as of March 2019), which means that among all cancer patients with approved indications, less than 10% of the lucky ones have the opportunity to use this therapy. People are born unable to choose whether they will get sick, let alone predict what kind of cancer they will get. No matter how hard they try to maintain their health, major diseases may still happen to you, me or your loved ones mercilessly. The idea of \u200b\u200bnational health insurance is to practice the ""social insurance"" system of risk sharing and social mutual assistance. The precious value of this system is that when a major disease occurs, patients can retain the opportunity and right to choose the best treatment method, regardless of whether they will be impoverished due to the disease or not, at least before the minimum wish of prolonging life. As the cancer clock continues to turn fast, the rate of cancer in the Chinese population is increasing, and the number of cancer patients is increasing, if the budget for new cancer immune drugs is always far below the current demand, it will inevitably go against the original intention of caring for the health of the Chinese people. Next year\'s health insurance new drug budget review is coming soon. We must positively review the plight of the cancer immune new drug budget to ensure the drug rights and interests of cancer patients now and in the future. Three major demands 1. New indications continue to increase, and the budget for new drugs and new indications should be deployed in advance. 2. Unreasonable payment conditions should be revised to give cancer patients higher medical quality and survival hope.', ""Save cancer patients, accelerate cancer immunotherapy (IO) into health insurance benefits in 2018Cancer has ranked first among the top ten causes of death in my country for 35 consecutive years. The number of cancer patients and cancer deaths continues to rise every year. In 2016, the number of deaths reached 47,760, accounting for 27.7% of all deaths. In the modern age where medical technology is constantly advancing, facing the problem of cancer, are cancer patients still helpless? The high mortality rate from cancer is due to the fact that my country often lags behind advanced countries by several years in the introduction of innovative drugs. For example, the latest cancer immunotherapy (IO) has been included in the international cancer treatment guidelines and has become a trend in cancer treatment. Neighboring countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia have included IO in their health insurance payments to provide patients with new treatment options. Cancer immunotherapy (IO) is to fight cancer cells by awakening the patient's own immune cells. According to various research data, immunotherapy can not only effectively control the disease, but also has lower side effects than traditional chemotherapy, and can enable end-cancer patients to have a better quality of life. For patients who continue to fight cancer, not only can they obtain the hope of extending life, but also help patients and caregivers reduce the life impact caused by cancer. This new cancer therapy is effective, but it has not been included in the national health insurance, and it is a great financial burden on patients and caregivers. Therefore, many cancer patients have been looking forward to the government's ability to include cancer immunotherapy in the national health insurance as soon as possible, so that patients can have the opportunity of new drug treatment. Fortunately, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has relevant plans, and the budget for cancer immunotherapy in 2017 was 1.27 billion yuan. But the bad news is that the timeline for new drugs to be included in the national health insurance is slow. The inclusion of new drugs in the national health insurance needs to go through administrative procedures such as expert review and joint health insurance drafting meetings. At present, it has been more than two years since the Food and Drug Administration issued the drug certificate for the payment of cancer immunotherapy. During this waiting process, more patients have lost their lives. National health insurance has introduced many new medical technologies and new drugs to help patients in the past. We appeal to patients and caregivers not to let patients and caregivers hope but to be disappointed again and again, to speed up the inclusion of immunotherapy into national health insurance benefits, and to protect patients' rights to use new medical technologies! The big question now is when will the NHS start paying for cancer immunotherapy? For cancer patients, time is the worst enemy! Cancer patients are racing against time, and administrative delays in the middle will cause more patients to miss the chance of treatment. Please help cancer patients who are struggling with death.

However, the current methods of cancer treatment in Taiwan's major hospitals are still based on traditional radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy. What terminal cancer patients in Taiwan do not know is that compared with neighboring countries such as China and Japan, they already have more advanced cancer immune cell therapy in clinical practice to provide options for terminal cancer patients. (Japan has applied this treatment method to clinical treatment as early as 2007; China's third-level hospitals have even applied this treatment to more than a thousand patients in clinical treatment). Terminal cancer patients in Taiwan have not been able to enjoy this treatment because the law is too outdated to allow this advanced treatment to be legally carried out in Taiwan, which has deprived Taiwan terminal cancer patients of more treatment options. This cancer immune cell therapy has not yet been approved by legislation in Taiwan. Recently, many patients have witnessed it personally, and more and more patients have gone abroad to try it. However, due to the lack of physical strength of cancer patients, they also need their family members to accompany them on trips at all times, which makes going abroad for treatment an unbearable necessity. To put it simply, this new type of cancer treatment is through cultivating immune cells and reinjecting them into the body to kill cancer cells and tumors by themselves. The key point is that this will not produce powerful side effects similar to radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body, so that terminal cancer patients can enjoy a better quality of life. Immunotherapy is really a sliver of life and new hope for some patients who cannot afford the traditional course of treatment, but Taiwan’s legislation needs to go through five or eight years of testing, not to mention the low efficiency of the Legislative Yuan to pass new bills! This makes cancer patients very sad, because they have no time to wait! Another thing that is even more unfair to terminal cancer patients in Taiwan is that the introduction of new drugs lags far behind that of the United States. With the current situation, if a new drug approved by the US FDA is to be introduced to Taiwan, it will have to go through a long human experiment process before it can be officially launched in Taiwan, and this process will take at least two years. This means that the earliest time for Taiwan's terminal cancer patients to enjoy the original new drug is three years later. For terminal cancer patients, it is already an old requirement, and they can't see it but can't eat it. If patients with terminal cancer do not have time to wait for more than three years, they need to report to the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a benevolent project. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has the power to veto the introduction. In addition, it takes more than a month for the official document to go abroad to get the medicine. Please imagine that if patients with terminal cancer really have so much time to wait, how can they be called terminal cancer patients? Therefore, here are two appeals: 1. Let the cancer immune cell therapy amendment bill be submitted to the Legislative Council before the end of December 2015 Court 2. Let the introduction of new cancer drugs be accelerated. The above two demands are to give more treatment options and opportunities to terminal cancer patients who are struggling with death. I hope that everyone can sign this proposal as soon as possible.

And basically, the teacher doesn’t just punish students for not having a lunch break for one day. If the punishment lasts for a long time, it will not only affect the students’ learning status, but also cause the students’ physical and mental fatigue, and even make them afraid to go to school. Therefore, it is suggested to revise the law, not to use the lunch break as a punishment, and to revise the limit of one class and the accumulated hours each time. After all, students do not go to school to be punished. Moreover, if the teacher punishes students for 30 minutes or 40 minutes each time, it is not much different from the time of a class, and teachers may use this legal loophole to punish students, resulting in inappropriate punishments that appear to be reasonable.', 'Cancel the lunch break of elementary and middle schools and increase the number of class dismissalsSitting and sleeping during lunch break is not only harmful to the spine, but also many students cannot fall asleep during the lunch break. However, some schools will force students to take a lunch break. As a result, some students who want to use the noon time to study or do other things cannot meet their needs.

Parking is only in the car grid, and other parking spaces are prohibited. 4 To promote the parking space law, car buyers can submit a parking space certificate, and renting or buying is also acceptable. 5 new project, mandatory one room, one parking space and locomotive.', 'Improve the parking chaos, modify the charging method and provide more parking spacesCars and motorcycles are parked randomly or even side by side on the roadside all over the country, which affects the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. The reason is that on the one hand, the citizens do not abide by the law and have poor public morality, and on the other hand, it is because of the lack of parking spaces that it is often difficult to find one, making it difficult to follow. Sufficient parking spaces should be provided first while vigorously banning, so as to alleviate the parking demand. If open spaces such as roadsides and roadways that meet safety conditions are designated as parking spaces for automobiles and motorcycles in an all-round way, a large number of parking spaces will be added and improved. However, no amount of parking spaces can satisfy all situations (uneven demand). Therefore, changing the charging method and adjusting the price flexibly according to the market mechanism can meet the demand for parking spaces in various places and improve the parking chaos. The method is as follows: 1. Conduct a comprehensive investigation to find open spaces such as roadsides and roadways that meet the safety conditions, designate them as parking spaces for automobiles and motorcycles, and charge for them comprehensively. 2. The price of the parking space is automatically adjusted according to the utilization rate, and the pricing is flexible, and the utilization rate is maintained between 90% and 50%. For example: According to the statistics of the billing unit, if the usage rate is greater than 90%, it will be increased by 1 yuan, and if it is less than 50%, it will be reduced by 1 yuan. 3. The price is adjusted according to the time of day to cope with the difference between peak and off-peak hours. 4. Statistics are made from Monday to Sunday and specific holidays and adjusted every day. Set a rough price at the beginning, and then it will be automatically adjusted to the best condition gradually. 5. High pricers shorten the pricing time (for example: pricing in units of 10 minutes) to increase the turnover rate. Those with low prices extend the pricing time (for example: calculated in units of 2 hours) to reduce charging costs. If the price is lower than the charging cost, it is free. 6. Publish the real-time parking price and occupancy status through the cloud, and the charges will be settled monthly. The central supervision unit will send a notice or automatically deduct the payment according to the license plate. You can also check the incurred fees and payment on the cloud. 7. Mark the charging levels during peak and off-peak hours on the parking spaces, for example: more than 10 yuan for 10 minutes, more than 20 yuan for 30 minutes, and more than 30 yuan for 1 hour..., so as to facilitate users who cannot connect to the cloud to make judgments. 8. Do not issue paper bills to reduce resource consumption, use image recognition license plate automatic billing and take pictures to store certificates, the toll collectors only need to ride or drive by at a slow speed, and only need to manually handle or report in case of special circumstances, such as license plate defacement, wrong parking position or direction, unlicensed vehicles... 9.

The assembly and modification of automobile and motorcycle parts in Taiwan are completely bound by the regulations made decades ago. Now there are many automobiles and motorcycles to choose from, but not everyone can choose to buy brand new models. Some people also choose cheaper and older used automobiles and motorcycles. If you can’t get the parts, you have to take the risk to use second-hand parts, which will also cause safety hazards to the driver. At present, too many people think that the so-called modification will only change the exhaust pipe to cause noise, and they will not go deep into what is the difference between ""original parts"" and ""refitted parts"". , There are parts that enhance the appearance of the car and personalize it, etc... And consumers are not everyone who only chooses ""original"" parts. Consumers also have so-called comparisons. The quality and price of the original factory, sub-factory, and other factories are different. Some people will choose similar parts that are cheaper. When buying refitting parts, you must have a good understanding of your car before you choose to buy them. For example: with the original factory assembly, I found that the grip was insufficient when cornering. In order to make myself safer, I bought non-original suspension system related parts and replaced them. I found that it was more stable when cornering and made driving safer. Why should I choose to use original parts to expose myself to a more dangerous situation? Taiwan currently has excessive restrictions and ambiguities on auto and motorcycle modification, and even lags behind other countries. It is illegal to buy and sell modified parts after assembly, which is very contradictory. Taiwan\'s laws and regulations should learn from advanced countries\' laws and regulations related to automobiles and motorcycles, so that Taiwan can have better automobile and motorcycle modification regulations. ※Taiwan will ban modified automobiles and motorcycles, but the inspectors do not have enough professional knowledge and insufficient information to check whether public vehicles have been illegally modified. There will also be people who do not have certain professional knowledge to report, only to find out that it is an oolong in the end, which wastes time and money for both the government and the accused. It is necessary to improve personnel education and training, and increase personnel professional knowledge, instead of allowing the public to report at will and waste too much time and resources.', ""Legality of Vehicle ModificationsVehicle modification is a hotly discussed topic among the public. Commercially available vehicles sold by depots have cost considerations, so some equipment may not be able to meet the needs of the public (such as: brake calipers affect the braking force, motorcycle brake levers are not suitable for each user but cannot be adjusted...etc.). And all countries in the world have clear modification laws and regulations, so that the public can make the performance and appearance of the vehicle more suitable for their own needs in compliance with the laws and regulations. 1. Taiwan is above the relevant laws and regulations, and there are no clear regulations. It is hoped that the relevant laws and regulations can be revised as soon as possible. There is no legal prohibition on the sales and purchase of modified cloth products, so there are many modified vehicle parts on the market for resale, but it is illegal for people to modify them after purchasing them. This is actually putting the cart before the horse. Not only does it not have a good regulatory effect, but it also does not have good efficiency and standards to make judgments when the government conducts relevant inspections. Japan has already practiced relevant laws and implementations for many years, and the government can learn from them to facilitate the efficient regulation of legal modifications and the production of modified parts. For example: Regulated modified parts must comply with the national environmental protection and vehicle safety standards before they can be legally produced and sold. The government issues a legal mark or barcode on the product, so that the public can identify whether it is a legal modified part when purchasing. In this way, it can not only encourage related industries to flourish, but also have government management, which is the best of both worlds. It is hoped that the relevant units will quickly formulate regulations to regulate whether the production and sales of modified parts meet the national environmental protection and vehicle safety standards, and only allow modified parts that meet relevant regulations and have passed national inspections to be legally certified to be sold, and allow the public to buy legal modified parts, so that people across the country can purchase and install legal and safe products according to the regulations. 2. Taiwan has recently strictly banned modified vehicles. However, the inspectors do not have enough professional knowledge and information to check whether public vehicles have been illegally modified. Some imported models pass the import inspection, but the inspection personnel will cancel the order due to personal feelings. The checker only said: I don't know if there is any modification, and I will bill first. Such disturbing and unprofessional judgments have left the public at a loss. Personnel education and training should be re-examined, and personnel professional knowledge should be increased, otherwise it will be a laughing stock of the society and the world, and the government will lose the credibility of law enforcement."", 'The content of vehicle safety modification is as follows:The car safety modification content is as follows: 1. Car shock absorber improvement and safety installation 2. Car tire size increase 3. Car wide body modification and airflow design 4. Brake safety improvement modification 5. Car internal structural rod strengthening modification 6. Car lamp brightness improvement modification relative to the safety improvement value of modification 1. Car shock absorber modification: Nowadays, the safety factor of shock absorbers provided by domestic original cars is generally low, higher than comfortable, but the pressure resistance effect is not as expected. It is unacceptable that the body cannot be effectively controlled to avoid accidents when special situations occur, and the installation of shock absorbers sold legally in the country does not comply with regulations! Legally sold should be legally installed. People who can’t afford high-priced cars have the absolute right to choose to improve the safety of their driving tools. If it’s safe for themselves, it’s also safe for others. Why not modify it? 2. Car tire size increase and modification can help the car’s grip performance during driving, and it’s not easy to slip out of control when driving. 3. Wide-body modification and airflow design are the mainstream design of high-priced original sports cars today. If supercars use this aspect as their design concept and concept, is there any professional unit in my country that can identify this as a dangerous modification or even not in compliance with regulations? Large-scale trucks and combined vehicles including tourist buses (which are regarded as chassis vehicles by the supervision station) can be heightened and widened according to regulations. In fact, professional vehicle modifications are used to judge the center of gravity. This type of vehicle belongs to high-risk modification, and government agencies openly allow illegal business vehicle modification! General car wide-body modification is to increase the width of the chassis for stable improvement, and use the airflow design to increase the downforce of the car body so as to maintain the balance of car body safety. 4. Brake safety refitting. Currently, car manufacturers want to have better fuel consumption performance, so they often reduce the weight of the brakes and replace them with poorer materials due to cost considerations. Most of them use small-scale cast iron discs with single-sided piston calipers. This brake system is prone to overheating and the braking effect is greatly reduced, and many collision accidents have occurred. If the brake system can be legally modified to improve the performance, the accidents caused by insufficient braking can be reduced. 5. The internal structural rods of the car are strengthened to prevent the car body from being deformed during the collision and extrusion, so that the injured can increase the chance of survival. Currently, the safety of the modified car is greatly improved, and it can also effectively guarantee the safety of the driver in terms of traffic safety. 6. Modification of the brightness of car lamps. The current laws and regulations have also begun to require the public to install daytime running lights. Taiwan’s supervisory units, including the Ministry of Communications, have no relevant professionals to judge whether modifying cars will affect driving safety. Conclusion: The current traffic laws and regulations are outdated, and the safety modification of cars is prohibited, but the dangerous modification of so-called chassis cars is open. Such as: lengthen, widen and heighten the rear body of the car (easily unstable center of gravity), install searchlights on the chassis of the connected car (make it easy for the driver to dazzle), install an electric rear moving body cover, increase the compartment of the sightseeing car (affecting the safety of passengers), and one-piece windows (difficult to escape). Taiwan’s traffic regulations need to be reviewed by professionals, not officials. High-level supervisors at supervision stations can describe wide-body bodies as “auxiliary ladders” and “aerodynamic kits.” If you can’t afford luxury cars, you can also buy high-end accessories to increase the safety of your vehicle. The government opens up the sale of modified imported parts but does not allow them to be installed? A specific object of profit? Back to the car users to modify the power.']"
218,217,13,217_menstrual_tampons_cups_sanitary,"['menstrual', 'tampons', 'cups', 'sanitary', 'cup', 'tampon', 'products', 'medical', 'women', 'napkins']","['Simplify the application process for importing menstrual cups for personal useWhy is there a need to import a menstrual cup for personal use? Although menstrual cups can be legally purchased in Taiwan, the fit of the menstrual cup is closely related to each woman\'s body shape and menstrual status. Currently, the number of domestic brands is limited, and it is temporarily unable to meet the different needs of all women for the shape, capacity and size of the menstrual cup. As a result, many women who pursue an environmentally friendly and plastic-free menstrual period, want to reduce the hot and itchy menstrual period, make menstrual period more comfortable, or want to use menstrual cups for various reasons still need to buy menstrual cups from abroad for their own use. Taiwan currently only has menstrual cups made of silicone. For women who are allergic to silicone, they can only use menstrual cups imported from other countries for their own use. Why not introduce more foreign brands to officially register? Taiwan has extremely strict regulations on the import and manufacture of menstrual cups, which makes it very difficult for foreign menstrual cup brands to enter the Taiwan market. We actually asked foreign manufacturers whether they would like to import to Taiwan, but found that most menstrual cups, even with the US FDA license, still do not meet the requirements of Taiwan\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare, which also restricts Taiwanese consumers\' right to choose. Suggestions for the current medical device importation plan for self-use 1. Cancel the ""doctor\'s certificate"" item in the menstrual cup importation plan. Although the medical device importation self-use plan can meet the above needs, it is necessary to provide a doctor\'s certificate. That is, women who want to apply for self-use but have no menstrual abnormalities or related medical history must ask the doctor to list normal menstruation as a disease before applying for a menstrual cup for self-use. This situation is unreasonable. The reason why the menstrual cup is classified as a medical device is because it needs to be inserted into the human body, not for the treatment of diseases. It is just one of many physiological products that women with good menstrual health can also use. If you apply for a menstrual cup for self-use, you need to provide a doctor’s certificate. Not only does it not keep pace with the modern value of removing the stigma of menstruation, but it may also increase the burden on doctors. In addition, in the first page, item 12, and first option of the ""Application for Import Consent of Goods"", personal use, as seen in the description, general patent medicines, oral vitamin preparations, and cosmetics are excluded from the items that require a doctor\'s certificate. I hope that the menstrual cups will be handled in the same way. 2. Process simplification and electronicization Since the EZway customs declaration system has been formed, we also understand that the government currently has many convenience projects that can be applied for online. If the moon cup can be imported into the online application or electronic customs declaration system in the future, such as directly uploading the application form, the occurrence of missing parts can be greatly reduced, and it will also make it more convenient for the public and contractors.', 'Menstrual cups compared to tampons legal online shoppingThere have always been many restrictions on the sales and promotion of menstrual products in Taiwan. Because tampons and menstrual cups, which are classified by the European Union as daily necessities, are officially classified as second-class medical products in Taiwan. In practice, second-class medical equipment requires a license and inspection procedures. Individual imports require a diagnostic certificate, resulting in fewer options for tampons, and menstrual cups. Menstrual cups, commonly known as ""moon cups"", are soft cups made of medical-grade silicone material. They can be rolled up and pushed into the vagina to hold menstrual blood. They are sterilized and cleaned before and after each menstrual period, and can be reused. Compared with tampons and tampons, they are more environmentally friendly and easy to carry. They can be reused for 5 to 10 years. They can greatly reduce the amount of garbage generated during menstruation and environmental pollution, and save the cost of purchasing disposable sanitary products. supplies. It\'s a pity that no company has produced or introduced it in Taiwan, which makes the product unfamiliar to Chinese people. Taiwanese girls who want to use it must go abroad to buy it by themselves, or entrust someone to buy it from abroad. Once discovered by the customs, they will be seized with prohibited medical equipment. Taking tampons as an example, the domestic tampon manufacturer Sharon started the long process of applying for a tampon medical equipment license in May 2008. It was not until March 2010 that the government finally gave it the go and allowed it to obtain a license to issue catheter tampons. In July 2010, Taiwan\'s first self-made catheter sliver brand ""KiraKira"" was launched, which became an important milestone in the development of Taiwan\'s sliver. Until January 2014, according to the Announcement No. 1021653168 issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, body fat meters, condoms, and tampons have been sold online by pharmacists after registration. Online shopping for tampons was officially opened, which represented a partial lifting of the ban and a relatively free circulation of daily necessities. In addition to the original three tampon brands, the new brand ""Moxie"" officially entered Taiwan in May of the same year. As of November 10, 2014, in the results of the medical equipment license inquiry of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, a total of five tampons (L5470. Unscented tampons) have been issued; the number of menstrual cups (L5400. Menstrual measuring cup) is still zero. At the beginning of 2015, the British brand ""Natracare Green Keer"", which has been operating in the organic cotton market for a long time, also entered the market, and the development of Taiwan\'s tampons was able to enter a new stage again. On August 28, 2015, the founder of Taiwanese tampon brand ""KiraKira"" deeply felt that it is easy for European and American women to obtain menstrual cups, but Taiwanese women can only find overseas agents to buy them, and because Taiwan\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare has not yet approved any review of similar products, international agents have to bear the risk of customs seizure. In order to break through this situation, start a new wave of menstrual revolution again, launch the ""Taiwan Moon Cup Crowdfunding Project"", focusing on ""the first moon cup designed for Taiwanese women"", reached the fundraising threshold of 3 million in just three days, and successfully raised NT$9.6 million after three months, showing Taiwanese women\'s response to the demand and concept of moon cup products. The menstrual cup development project was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the product has been submitted for preclinical testing and biocompatibility testing. The menstrual cup (L5400. Menstrual measuring cup), which was originally listed as zero in the medical equipment license of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, is expected to issue the first license in the third quarter of 2016. According to Announcement No. 1011606990 dated November 1, 2011 and Announcement No. 1021653168 dated January 2, 2013, drug dealers with physical stores are allowed to sell first-grade medical equipment and second-level medical equipment such as body fat meters, condoms, and tampons on the Internet. General public are not allowed to sell medical equipment online. Before the ""Taiwan Moon Cup Crowdfunding Project"" was launched, there were two associations on the Internet that purchased moon cups for a long time, and they always risked being reported, fined or seized by customs. However, the principle of use of menstrual cups is different from that of tampons. They are used to collect menstrual blood instead of absorbing menstrual blood. They are non-absorbent, so there is no possibility of causing dryness of the vaginal lining and triggering TSS toxic shock syndrome. In the United States, there is no need to submit a pre-marketing declaration form, which is looser than the regulations for tampons. Therefore, it is recommended to open online sales similar to tampons. According to the Announcement No. 1021653168 of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in January 2014, body fat meters, condoms, and tampons have been sold online by pharmaceutical companies after registration. Therefore, it should follow this precedent when asking whether to open other secondary medical devices. The proposal at this stage is not to amend the medical device classification of menstrual cups in the current regulations, but to list menstrual cups as an item open to online shopping. We firmly believe that only reasonable distribution channels can attract more manufacturers willing to import and invest in the expansion of L.5400 items, so as to increase the choice of menstrual products for Taiwanese girls, and under the management of policies, truly guarantee the safety of consumers.', 'Menstrual cups compared to tampons legal online shoppingThere have always been many restrictions on the sales and promotion of menstrual products in Taiwan. Because tampons and menstrual cups are classified as daily necessities by the European Union, they are officially classified as second-class medical equipment in Taiwan. In practice, licenses and inspection procedures are required. Individual imports require a diagnostic certificate, resulting in fewer options for tampons, and menstrual cups. Menstrual cups, commonly known as ""moon cups"", are soft cups made of medical-grade silicone material. They can be rolled up and pushed into the vagina to hold menstrual blood. They are sterilized and cleaned before and after each menstrual period, and can be reused. Compared with sanitary napkins and tampons, they are more environmentally friendly and easy to carry. They can be reused for five to ten years. They can greatly reduce the amount of garbage generated during menstruation and environmental pollution, and save the cost of purchasing disposable sanitary products. . It\'s a pity that no manufacturer has produced or introduced it in Taiwan yet, causing Chinese people to feel unfamiliar with this product. Taiwanese girls who want to use it must go abroad to buy it by themselves, or entrust someone to buy it from abroad. Once discovered by the customs, they will be seized with prohibited medical equipment. Taking tampons as an example, the domestic tampon manufacturer Sharon started the long process of applying for a tampon medical equipment license in May 2008. It was not until March 2010 that the government finally gave it the go and allowed it to obtain a license to issue catheter tampons. In July 2010, Taiwan\'s first self-made catheter tampon brand ""KiraKira"" was finally launched, which became an important milestone in the development of Taiwan\'s menstrual products. Until January 2014, according to the announcement No. 1021653168 of the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, body fat meters, condoms, and tampons have been opened to drug dealers to sell online after registration. The opening of tampons to online purchases means that tampons have partially lifted the ban and become a relatively free-flowing daily necessities. In addition to the original three tampon brands, the new brand ""Moxie"" officially entered Taiwan in May of the same year. As of November 2014, in the results of the medical equipment license inquiry of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, only five tampons (L5470. Unscented tampons) were issued, and zero menstrual cups (L5400. Menstrual measuring cup). At the beginning of 2015, the British brand ""Natracare Green Keer"", which has been operating organic cotton products for a long time, also entered the tampon market, and Taiwan\'s tampon development was able to enter a new stage again. On August 28, 2015, the founder of Taiwanese tampon brand ""KiraKira"" deeply felt that it is easy for European and American women to obtain menstrual cups, but Taiwanese women can only find overseas agents to buy them, and because Taiwan\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare has not yet approved any review of similar products, international agents have to bear the risk of customs seizure. In order to break through this situation, start a new wave of menstrual revolution again, launch the ""Taiwan Moon Cup Crowdfunding Project"", focusing on ""the first moon cup designed for Taiwanese women"", reached the fundraising threshold of 3 million in just three days, and successfully raised NT$9.6 million after three months, showing Taiwanese women\'s response to the demand and concept of moon cup products.

220,219,12,219_facial_recognition_mosaic_criminals,"['facial', 'recognition', 'mosaic', 'criminals', 'victims', 'face', 'victim', 'data', 'images', 'intimate']","[""Victims' privacy, human rightsThe criminal has already destroyed all the rights of the victim at the moment of committing the crime. Why does the news media make us this kind of perpetrator? Why not change the problem? And some people think that even if the crime is reported, no one knows the face of the criminal. On the contrary, the personal information of the victim is made public. It is easy to take revenge and bully. This is already a violation of the privacy and human rights of the victim! All the news media in Taiwan often cover the prisoner’s face with a mosaic in the videos provided by the public, but the victim has no mosaic at all and is repeatedly broadcast by the news media, which in turn causes the victim’s psychological injury for the second or third time, and may also be ridiculed and bullied by relatives, friends or unknown people. Taiwan’s society has to allow all the news media to play with the victim’s reputation for a long time, so I suggest that when the major news media report, except for the prisoner, everyone else must be mosaiced to report. In addition, if the victim attends a press conference or other occasions, he must wear a mask and a hat to protect his privacy. News media that play with the victim’s reputation like ratings will be fined more than 500,000 per number of times (for example: when a TV station broadcasts the noon news again and again at night, and if there is no improvement, the fine will be 1 million). Even if the fine is not that high, at least legislate to protect the people. (Just adding a mosaic to protect the victim) The police will definitely protect the faces of the prisoners when escorting them, and the victim will let the news media take enough pictures without making a mosaic at all. The police should protect the safety of the public instead of letting the news media take enough pictures! Moreover, the recidivism rate of prisoners is also high, because no one knows that they can continue to commit crimes just by changing their names. P.S. When some major cases occur, it can also speed up the time to find the prisoners so that they cannot escape from the country."", 'Improve the single help window for victims of digital sexual violenceIn today\'s Taiwanese society, news of sexually intimate images and leaked nude photos is common in various media. Once the images are distributed in the online world, the victims often suffer indelible harm. The victim is not only infringed on sexual privacy and reputation, but on a deeper level, his sense of security in the world and his sense of trust between people are completely shattered after the incident. Anxiety, depression, fear, and isolation are often the emotional reactions that the victim may have. What\'s worse, once the image is uploaded, it is difficult to completely delete it. . Under the current system, if the outflow of intimate sexual images involves sexual assault, domestic violence, and intimate relationship violence, according to existing laws such as the Sexual Assault Prevention Act and the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, victims can seek assistance from domestic violence and sexual assault prevention centers throughout Taiwan. However, in cases where sexually intimate images are leaked, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim is diverse. For example, in cases that do not involve existing special laws, such as secretly photographed by strangers, online friends, or stolen records by hackers, government departments have very few resources to provide victims. Therefore, it is expected that social welfare institutions can improve the channels for help and integrate existing resources, and include all victims of sexually intimate images into the protection system. Specifically, it is recommended that the competent social welfare authorities should: (1) Draft a standard operating procedure for dealing with the outflow of sexually private images. After the outbreak of the Room N incident in South Korea in 2019, the Taipei Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs formulated a standard operating procedure for digital sexual violence. Regardless of whether it involves existing special laws, it can be included in the protection system of the Home Defense Center. In the future, it is hoped that social welfare authorities across the country will be able to formulate standard operating procedures for digital sexual violence based on their resource allocation. As long as the case involves the leakage of sexually intimate images, they can enter the existing protection system and avoid the dilemma of victims having nowhere to seek help. (2) Improvement of anonymous telephone counseling services Many victims of digital sexual violence are unwilling to disclose their identities when seeking help. In the telephone counseling service, an option to seek help anonymously should be added to build trust with the victim, encourage more victims to seek help from the outside world, and provide immediate guidance on video removal, evidence preservation, and psychological assistance, and then follow-up treatment depending on the individual case. (3) Strengthen the education and training of relevant personnel, and develop the ""Reference Handling Process for Sexual Private Image Leakage Cases"", establish basic handling guidelines and related precautions for social workers, and help smooth the handling process (4) Promote digital sexual violence prevention education and publicity 1. Strengthen the public\'s understanding of the channels for seeking help 2. Improve the social atmosphere Today, the public\'s understanding of digital sexual violence crimes is still insufficient, and the social attitude towards Internet pornography tends to be entertainment rather than crime. The unhealthy trend of the crime is tantamount to causing secondary harm to the victims. The competent authority should educate the public on this part and structurally improve the plight of the victims. (5) Establish a cooperation mechanism among relevant units Police agencies, home defense centers, and iwin image processing agencies should establish a sound cooperation mechanism, and each department needs to implement a professional confidentiality mechanism to establish trust between the victim and the help system. (6) Incorporate digital sexual violence into the business scope of the 113 help line, and provide instant 24-hour assistance to victims (7) Improve the supporting measures related to the existing draft. The current draft regulations on the prevention of sexual privacy image infringement crimes are still mostly general provisions on the protection of victims, and the supporting measures in the legal aspect should be improved.', 'It is suggested that the collection, management and application of face recognition technology should be regulatedAI face recognition technology can already be applied to all aspects of life such as mobile payment, public safety, check-in, and fatigue recognition. It is undeniable that facial recognition has its benefits (see 6), and it may be widely used in Taiwan in the future. Compared with traditional personal data (such as name, phone number, address, etc.), facial data is more widely used, so when it is leaked, the damage will be greater. If you can unlock the door of your home with just one face, and you can deduct money from your account, then if your facial feature data is leaked, the consequences will be disastrous. And facial recognition technology is more likely to be abused or invaded privacy, but the government\'s norms are quite ambiguous. In the case of unclear boundaries between powers and responsibilities, sometimes disputes will arise (such as the incident of Taiwan Railways installing face recognition at the station (see 4), the incident of Taichung Girls’ High School dormitory collecting the facial data of boarding students without consent), which may cause social resources to be wasted. Moreover, face recognition technology has its limitations and should not be overly relied on (for example, there have been cases in foreign countries where face recognition was used to arrest murderers but caught the wrong person (see 5)). At present, the only administrative order concerning the collection, management and use of facial features is the ""Measures for the Collection, Management and Use of Personal Biometric Identification Data"" (Refer to 2) of the Immigration Agency of the Ministry of the Interior, which only regulates how the Immigration Agency manages the information collected from people entering and leaving the country (including fingerprints and facial features). Therefore, how general administrative agencies, schools, companies, and private institutions collect, manage, and use facial data is only regulated by the government as the name, address and other personal data stipulated in the Personal Data Protection Act (see 7) (see 1). In terms of collection, if public departments, schools, and companies request to collect facial data of citizens, employees, and students, it is almost impossible to refuse. In terms of application, the boundaries of improper use are not clear. For example, it is not clear whether facial recognition is used to record whether factory employees doze off or not. As for the storage of facial data, the government has not set a basic threshold. How to ensure that the facial data collected by the organization will not be hacked due to insufficient protection capabilities? Therefore, I think the government should set up regulations on the following points: 1. When it comes to personal safety (home), important property (banks, payment), etc., face recognition should not be used as the only unlocking tool, and a second authentication is required (for example, a password is still required for face-scanning payment). 2. Standardize the protection methods and specifications for the storage of facial data. 3. Standardize that facial recognition monitors cannot record public information. For example, the public security system of a train station will remind station attendants that there are ""blacklisted"" people entering the station (of course, it cannot be reasonably inferred that people on the ""blacklisted"" will definitely commit crimes or that people who are not on the blacklist will not commit crimes). 4. Schools must obtain parental consent before collecting facial data of underage students. 5. Facial recognition should not be used as direct criminal evidence. 6. Set a reasonable threshold for engaging in the collection, management and use of biometric data by referring to the establishment standards of commercial banks.

They hope that the public will have more awareness and attention to depression, but the results are not as expected. The public has no more understanding and contact with depression, and the prevalence of depression has no downward trend. Find the right person to complain, and you can only face it yourself. The society is full of various labels for depression and other mental illnesses, which not only makes depression patients encounter many difficulties in studying and working, but also makes potential patients with physical and mental symptoms afraid to seek medical treatment and unwilling to admit that they are sick. Taiwanese society does not know much about mental illness, and most of them tend to have a negative impression; coupled with the fact that the public does not know much about their own mental state, this leads to a lack of ""sickness"" for depression, and they think that mental illness is no more serious than physical illness. For example: A well-known artist surnamed Wu made a statement on the show that ""the cause of depression is all because of dissatisfaction"", which shows that the myth of depression needs to be improved. The government has vigorously publicized physical diseases such as AIDS, pneumonia, cancer, etc. to let the public understand and prevent them. It is hoped that the same publicity effect can be achieved for mental diseases. The scourge brought by mental diseases is not less than that of physical diseases. Depression is included in the top ten causes of death in Taiwan. It is hoped that government agencies can pay more attention to the publicity of related mental diseases and ignore the social burden caused by depression.

Arcades are a feature of urban landscapes in Taiwan. They are originally intended for pedestrians. Article 10 of the Land Tax Reduction and Exemption Regulations stipulates: ""Land value tax shall be exempted or reduced for arcades and corridors for public traffic."" This means that the owner has already enjoyed the tax reduction and exemption from the government. However, there have been occupations and establishment of stalls, containment of business operations, conversion of parking spaces, and accumulation of sundries, causing disputes too numerous to enumerate. There is an arcade that has been occupied by Lanxunjie for more than 25 years, but there was an arcade in the same section of the road, and it is set back 3.64 meters. There is a completely open sidewalk, and the whole landscape has completely changed. Taiwan is narrow and densely populated. In addition, buildings and houses are designed under the design of arcades. The roads are narrowed and the people can\'t breathe. As a result, the ventilation in the city is not good. Under the vicious circle, urban ovens have roasted the people into irritable and weak people, and the country has paid a lot of cost. Also because of poor ventilation, people absorb waste gas, people become air filters, and respiratory diseases are common diseases. Given the environment of the island nation of Taiwan, the air should be clean, so why are there frequent respiratory diseases? During the 206 Hualien earthquake, several buildings collapsed, including Yuncui, Commander-in-Chief, and Weiguan Building in Tainan the year before last.

Why are arcades reserved for pedestrians under Taiwan law? The land of arcades is counted as private land, and the government has not paid rent to house owners. Why do they have to be left empty for pedestrians to walk? Why can\'t arcades be parked? Why can\'t arcades be set up for stalls?', 'The right to use arcades returns to the landlord without being bound by lawIt is proposed to revoke the ""Definition of Road: ""Arcade"""" in Article 3 of the Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations. Reason 1. The arcade is private land, and the right to use it is privately owned. If a landlord wants to legally open a shop, park a car, etc. on his own land and use private land space, it is illegal and quite unreasonable. Reason 2. According to Article 82 of the Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations, roads (including arcades) should not be piled up, placed, installed or thrown to obstruct traffic. Violators will be fined NT$1,200 to NT$2,400. But have the police actually implemented this ordinance and reported it according to the law? In all counties and cities in Taiwan, ""roads (arcade buildings)"" have been illegally occupied, and there are many cases. Since very few people have reported according to the law, it shows that the occupation of the arcade will not cause trouble to the people. Reason 3. Now local governments have set up sidewalks in many crowded places. Since the government has provided space for people to walk, why open private land-arcade buildings to public roads? Is it necessary to open two-way pedestrian lanes? In places where there are no sidewalks, the crowds are relatively sparse, so even though pedestrians walk along the sidewalk, it will not affect vehicles driving in the middle of the road (except for illegal driving). *It is hereby suggested that the government increase the budget for the establishment of sidewalks in order to maintain the right of way of pedestrians. Reason 4. Arcade buildings are private land open to the public. Whether to maintain or not is still up to the landlord. If a section of public road is not maintained and the ground is damaged and dirty, it may cause pedestrians to stumble. Reason 5. Because the arcades are part of private buildings, the heights of the arcades in different buildings are not the same, which may cause the risk of people slipping, so some arcades are not suitable for the public to pass.']"

It is only because companies do not need to pay foreign workers three-day bonuses and labor health insurance, which makes companies more and more like to hire foreign workers to reduce costs. Taiwanese job opportunities are reduced. In addition, due to the low wages of foreign workers, it is difficult for Taiwanese wages to increase. This reduces the willingness of Taiwanese youth to find employment. It is suggested that there should be a certain distance between the wages of Taiwanese workers and foreign workers, and that companies must hire at least two-thirds of Taiwanese to increase employment opportunities for Taiwanese. The increase in wages can also increase young people's willingness to work and reduce the unemployment rate."", 'The Ministry of Labor should build a network platform related to salary transparencyTaiwan’s real wages have fallen back for 16 years, and more than 3 million workers earn less than 30,000 yuan a month. Low wages have become a common situation among Taiwanese workers. The result of long-term low quality of life has seriously eroded the physical and mental health of the people. Tracing back to the source, Taiwan\'s existing ""Fair Trade Act"" can prevent companies from jointly monopolizing prices in the commodity market, but there is no effective mechanism to prevent companies from jointly monopolizing wages in the labor market. ""Market price"" has become a tacit understanding among companies. And when we started out in the society, we looked at the salary ""negotiable"" in the recruitment advertisements. In order to improve our acceptance rate, lowering our salary has become an unavoidable choice, and because of such weak information, it will affect subsequent salary increases and promotions. After a few years of hard work, maybe the salary is still not as good as the boss\'s relatives, Xiao Wang or Xiao San. However, after salary transparency, in addition to eliminating the above-mentioned problem of asymmetric information in the labor market, it will reveal illegal companies that pay less than the minimum wage, and eliminate unscrupulous companies that offer wages that are significantly lower than the market conditions of the occupation. Job seekers will flow to companies that are willing to pay higher wages, and the allocation of the labor market will be more reasonable. In terms of actual practice, it is possible to use the amount of labor insurance insurance or the declaration data of the National Taxation Bureau to calculate, impose the obligation on the enterprise to provide data, or provide the labor on its own initiative. It is also possible to disclose the actual salary, salary calculation formula, or salary classification. Only when people can get a reasonable salary can they have the motivation to stay in Taiwan; if companies that only want to give bananas can only hire monkeys, companies will have the incentive to take the initiative to raise wages.

Related news and books in the market: 1. On April 8, 107, Lianhe News: ""Taiwan\'s wage stagnation central bank: the government must intervene"", mentioning that the bargaining power of labor and capital is not equal, resulting in increased productivity but wage stagnation. The central bank believes that ""the government absolutely must intervene"" and stand on the side of the weak; In order to solve the problem of low wages, the central bank suggested that the government can raise the minimum wage and urge companies to raise wages through moral suasion, providing incentives or coercive means. Taiwan\'s labor productivity and real wage growth are also clearly out of touch. Since 1994, Taiwan\'s labor productivity has grown by more than 110 percent cumulatively, but real wages have grown by less than 30 percent. According to the central bank\'s analysis, the main reason is that the proportion of labor compensation in GDP has dropped, the money earned from exports has not kept up with prices, and the proportion of non-salary compensation such as health insurance has increased, which has caused Taiwan\'s low wages. 2. Generation Misanthropy - Low Salary, Poverty and an Unseen Future, written by Wu Chenghong, Moon Bear Publishing, first edition on November 29, 2017, pages 118 to 122 said: The government has always used GDP figures to prove economic capabilities, but in fact GDP has been disconnected from people’s real life. Based on the three economic indicators of the US economy, productivity, and median household income from 1992 to 2009, we can find that in the past 18 years, the US economy and productivity indicators Both show a growing trend, but the median household income has almost stagnated. As for the calculation method of GDP, the most familiar calculation method for the general public is ""the total value of consumption plus investment, government expenditure and exports minus imports"", which means that even if the net value of consumption, investment and exports does not grow or even declines, as long as government spending increases, GDP will also grow. This is what the government often calls ""expanding domestic demand"". [Now everyone knows the reason why the forward-looking infrastructure construction plan of 880 billion yuan was pushed forward] 3. Low wages are already a fact. Stagnant or even retrograde wages will seriously affect our country’s future national security and economic development. Since our government often uses the establishment of a “so-and-so office” as a response to problems, it is recommended that the government establish a “salary increase office” as soon as possible, so as to save the raging tide of wage collapse and save the common people from the crisis. 2.

(2) If you want to do routine work: just copy any of the current temporary organizations (committees), which is nothing more than the deputy head of the agency as the chairman, and the relevant ministries and committees as members.

[Although the interests behind industrial pollution are the lifeblood of the national economy, it is unfair to the people in the polluted areas. ] For example, most petrochemical/steel products are manufactured in Kaohsiung, and pollution and industrial safety problems are serious. Not only is there a big gap in the quality of life between Taipei and Kaohsiung, but the average life expectancy in Beigao is also more than 4 years behind. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior in 2019, Kaohsiung City, one of the six capitals, has the shortest life expectancy. If you refer to [103 Health Risk Assessment Plan for Residents in the Adjacent Area of \u200b\u200bLinhai Industrial Zone, Kaohsiung City], the biggest cause of short life may be pollution. Kaohsiung City has suffered from the pollution of most heavy industries, but in daily life, Kaohsiung people do not enjoy cheap oil prices due to oil refinery pollution, nor do they sacrifice their quality of life. Long-term industrialized cities have economic growth like northern science and technology parks. [However, these sacrifices are worthwhile for the central government. 】 Living environment, relatively clean areas such as the northern region, enjoy a clean environment, pure ocean, rich seafood, enjoy the dream of the city, and enjoy convenient and safe transportation. Living environment, relatively polluted areas such as Kaohsiung Xiaogang District, Linyuan District, Renwu District, Da Community, Yunlin Mailiao Township, etc., enjoy polluted air, enjoy the fear of industrial safety accidents, and enjoy the danger of dense traffic with large vehicles. (These areas also used to have clean air or oceans.) The central government distributed economic achievements to the whole country (the largest proportion is in the north), leaving pollution to be borne by certain areas for decades. Some polluted industrial areas have no exit mechanism, and even no urban planning control. The end of pollution is far away. (For example, the Linhai Industrial Zone in Kaohsiung City was developed in the 1970s. It covers an area of \u200b\u200babout 4.719 million pings (1,560 hectares). It is the largest industrial zone near the metropolitan area in Taiwan. However, it belongs to the ""Urban Planning Outside"" compilation and is directly under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is not regulated by the Kaohsiung City Urban Planning Law. Because the central government in the north is in control, and considering the 8 million votes in the north, it is impossible for the government to [fairly] distribute pollution sources to the north, center, and south. (So, let’s keep pollution as usual. People in the south only had more than 5 million votes. They turned a blind eye. Anyway, few people care about it. I guess ~ the central government thinks so.) From another perspective, in the anti-nuclear movement of the whole people, people in Kaohsiung and Yunlin who do not have nuclear energy are also enthusiastically participating in the struggle. Many people have anti-nuclear slogans on their clothes or motorcycles. But for decades of long-term pollution in the south, there are actually not many people in other regions participating in the struggle. [I hope to have better living security ~ this should be the most humble request] Therefore, I hope that the central government can provide more protection for these polluted areas, for example, residents within a radius of 10 kilometers from the pollution source ~ registered residents can enjoy [free medical insurance, accident insurance], and the expenses will be provided by the central government until the pollution source ends.', 'Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park adds a new play space for 2~12 years oldParents in Kaohsiung asked about the possibility of adding a playground in Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park. The competent authority replied that it was a landfill site in the past, so the geology is unstable and it is not suitable for a playground. However, Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park is located on the side of Qiaoxin 1st Road. In the past, there was a more distinctive climbing frame, but it was demolished due to a broken rope. There is also a case of a new playground in a landfill site in Taipei (Shanshuilv Ecological Park), which shows that Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park is not unsuitable for playgrounds. In addition, although the Kaohsiung City Government has worked hard to give children the right to play and gradually built characteristic playgrounds, it is facing the financial constraints of urban transformation and cannot meet the needs of local parents and children. At present, there is only one set of slides for children under the age of five in the existing playground, which cannot meet the needs of children over the age of 6. We hope that the central competent authority (Construction Administration of the Ministry of the Interior) will assist in improving the function of the urban park and restoring its playground function. It is also expected to expand to Waterfall Plaza or Celebration Plaza, or to find another open space with stable geological conditions and close to the toilet to add a playground for children aged 2-12, and open citizens to participate in the design of the playground for Kaohsiung children.', 'Kaohsiung City Industrial City TransformationKaohsiung City is a major industrial city in my country, and its industrial structure is dominated by manufacturing and industry, specifically including petrochemical, steel, and energy industries; although these industries have made outstanding contributions to the economic growth of Kaohsiung City and even our country. However, in view of the transformation of the economic pattern, many industrial cities in the world choose to adjust their urban development strategies and carry out the transformation of industrial cities when facing the change of economic pattern. Many of them have already achieved significant results, including the Ruhr Industrial Zone in Germany and Manchester in the United Kingdom. Urban transformation involves many aspects, including economic, social, cultural and political processes, and also involves many different values, such as economic development, environmental protection, health and safety, etc. Therefore, how to integrate different interests and multiple stakeholders into the policy-making process is an important element in the transformation of Kaohsiung City\'s industrial city. After the petrochemical gas explosion in Kaohsiung in 2002, Mayor Chen Ju once expressed his feelings: ""Whether the petrochemical industry and even the petrochemical zone should be located in Kaohsiung must be decided by the citizens of Kaohsiung!"" It can be seen that the petrochemical industry plays a key role in the future urban development of Kaohsiung. It is impossible for us to discuss Kaohsiung\'s urban transformation without discussing the petrochemical industry and other industrial issues. Mayor Chen Ju has publicly declared that the central government and relevant units of the city government are duty-bound to carry out clear policy planning for Kaohsiung\'s urban transformation; however, in the initial stage of planning, Mayor Chen\'s instructions should be implemented, and all citizens of Kaohsiung City should participate through open, fair and just procedures. We understand that the participation of the whole people is a form, but how to implement it depends on the design of the system. This part should be planned and managed by the central government and relevant bureaus of the Kaohsiung City Government. The goal is to promote the transformation of Kaohsiung City\'s industrial city and implement Mayor Chen Ju\'s political views. Therefore, we have the following propositions: First, the Ministry of the Interior and the Kaohsiung City Government should immediately start to formulate citizen participation procedures to explore strategies for the transformation of Kaohsiung City\'s industrial city. Second, the procedure must implement the mayor\'s political opinions, include relevant policy stakeholders, and be jointly decided by all Kaohsiung citizens. The method must meet the needs of democracy, science, and citizens. Third, the relevant units of the city government should strive to implement the decisions or suggestions made in this process. If other central and local government powers and responsibilities are involved, the Kaohsiung City Government must work hard to coordinate and achieve what the mayor and citizens entrust.']"

Therefore, it is proposed to change all policies containing the word ""homeless"" to ""homeless"".The term ""homeless"" has been influenced by the media and has created a negative impression in the hearts of the public. It has also unintentionally produced cognitive differences and biases towards street sleepers. In order to avoid this situation, it is proposed to change the name of homeless to homeless, remove the role of homeless as wandering around the streets with nothing to do, and tell the public that homeless are just like ordinary people, but lost their homes due to various reasons. What we need to do is not to despise them, but to provide them with more warmth so that they can return to society as soon as possible.', 'Create a win-win situation on the issue of homeless people / optimize the living environment of the publicForeword The causes of homelessness in cities are extremely complex, influenced by many factors such as unemployment, employment demand, economic development, social policies, and family relationships. Therefore, more active attempts must be made to get homeless people out of their homeless lives. In addition, homeless people should be regarded as homeless people, not lazy begging and muddling along. At present, the only way to dial 1999 is to send social workers from the social bureau to care. No one can forcibly move a homeless person to a shelter, unless he is in danger of self-injury or injury, he can be forced to seek medical treatment. In May 2011, the Ministry of the Interior announced the ""Example of Self-Government Regulations on Homeless Resettlement and Counseling"". Article 4 outlines the division of labor: (1) After identifying the identity, notify the family members to take it back (2) Those who need medical treatment, escort them to seek medical treatment (3) Those who have no household registration or are homeless, they will be resettled by the local government. It is also mentioned that ""environmental maintenance and site management rights and responsibilities of places where homeless people often gather shall be handled by the competent authorities."" However, because there is no more active cooperative relationship, in practice, the implementation may be reduced to one pass after another, and it will be repeated continuously, making it difficult to deal with it effectively. Since both homeless people and environmental issues are the biggest problems of this century, the following ideas are proposed based on the two situations. Question 1. Most homeless people\'s jobs do not provide dignity, and they suffer from discrimination in their daily lives. (For example, underground passages where homeless people gather are often regarded as dangerous, and homeless people are often directly accused of being perpetrators when incidents occur.) 2. Seventy percent of homeless people have jobs, but most of them are unstable. The physical condition is very difficult, and the salary is very low. The weak body of the homeless people cannot bear the burden for a long time. 3. Social discrimination against homeless people is huge, and many people have no motivation to live. The little entertainment left may seem to passers-by as just eating and waiting to die, not doing business properly. 4. There are few large-scale parks in Taiwan, and the greening can be improved. In terms of urban construction methods, it can not only create a richer sense of space on the limited land, but also provide a better living environment for the people. Proposal The sequence that homeless people may need to actively reintegrate into society 1. A home with a sense of belonging (friends with shared living experience, work colleagues, people who really care about them) 2. Communication between the public and homeless people, and gradually eliminate discrimination while caring. 4. A sense of legitimacy and a sense of accomplishment to help slow down the greenhouse effect (it is no longer a job that is looked down upon, but a common mission for human beings. Encouragement at work can also make them feel fulfilled.) Project details I hope that part of the budget can be used to establish tree planting organizations for the disadvantaged, or to cooperate with civil society groups. Employing disadvantaged groups, especially homeless people, to carry out afforestation and maintenance work, and can cooperate with tree burial services and subsidies to the public, turning tree planting into a meaningful thing in life. With new ritual activities, a fixed day of the year becomes extraordinarily meaningful through ritual activities. Commemorative activities also create commerciality, continue to earn profits to pay employees\' salaries, and create a win-win situation for the people, the environment, and homeless people. The homeless apartment is a container house, which is more practical in cost, easy to decorate, and suitable for mobile characteristics, which is convenient for afforestation and maintenance in different locations in the future. The design of the apartment can cooperate with the interior design students to understand the homeless when communicating needs, resolve stereotypes, and apply what they have learned to practice. The tree planting organization is managed, the government provides resources, and the beneficiaries are rewarded with labor. A clear agreement has also been formulated. Those who violate the contract will no longer have this opportunity for relief, so as to avoid wasting resources and opportunities on those who are not worth it. On the contrary, the resources of other disadvantaged groups are divided up. (For example, the elderly living alone, single pregnant women...) During the period, you can exchange for courses, job changes, rewards and internship opportunities according to your labor and work performance. Create hope and warmth in the process of work and life, a warm and positive home. The central government continues to integrate the fragmented and unused land, and the weak tree planting organizations continue to afforestation and maintenance. After gradually dispelling social discrimination, help external cases. Eventually a new industry was formed. What can be improved Homeless people Sleep problems Work problems Public perception, discrimination, confrontation and other social cost issues Environment Windbreak forests and afforestation on idle land to improve water and soil conservation. Air purification. Integration and planning of larger parks can improve social well-being (the number of too small parks is large, and the benefits to the climate and people’s recreation may be worse than those of fewer but larger parks). Carry forward the spirit of freedom and friendship in Taiwan.', ""Strengthen legal protection of homeless people's rightsHave you ever seen homeless people in the streets, parks and underground passages enduring the scorching heat, cold winter and heavy rain? Have you ever seen in the news media or with your own eyes that these homeless people are discriminated against and bullied by ordinary people, and even the discrimination or bullying may come from government agencies (Note 1)? A careful analysis of the structure of homeless people reveals that the composition of homeless people is highly heterogeneous, which may be caused by changes in the external environment (such as economic recession), changes in social trends, and lack of support from the overall welfare service network. Summarized from the timeline of the formation of homeless people, it can be found that the formation of homeless people is mostly due to work problems (such as unemployment) or family problems (such as family pressure), which lead to living on the streets; and because of the lack of housing, it is difficult to be accepted by the job market, forming a vicious circle of mutual influence between housing problems and work problems; and under the poor sanitation environment and social pressure, homeless people often have health and mental problems (Note 2). Based on the above-mentioned reasons for the formation of homeless people, we advocate a sound social welfare system for homeless people, provide them with assistance in housing, employment, and medical care, and encourage the society to re-understand them, so as to improve the situation where they are repeatedly discriminated against and bullied, and help homeless people return to society. Problems with the definition of vagrants: The current law authorizes local governments to define vagrants on their own, causing local governments to act independently (attached table), which in turn prevents the function of resettlement and counseling for homeless people from being implemented, and also causes a breakdown in the delivery of welfare services, causing more homeless problems (for example, homeless people who go to different counties and cities receive different resettlement counseling measures, and even lose the qualifications of homeless people at all. The Legislative Yuan has long known about this problem, Note 3). Therefore, we advocate that the definition of vagrants should be uniformly defined in the social assistance law to avoid the continuous occurrence of multiple systems in one country. Housing problems for homeless people: The current social housing and rent subsidy policies cannot meet the needs of homeless people; and the resettlement services provided by the government cannot provide long-term and stable housing assistance for homeless people. Therefore, we propose that through the revision of the Social Assistance Law and the Income Tax Law, the willingness of the resettlement organizations to be rebuilt will be increased through the method of rewarding the floor area ratio; and the tax incentives for profit-making enterprises on the income tax of profit-making enterprises will be provided to increase the incentives for them to cooperate with the resettlement organizations. The problem of homeless employment: the vocational training of the current law cannot provide substantial help to the homeless, and the government has not provided job security for the homeless. Therefore, we advocate that homeless people should be included in the scope of employment assistance and employment training subsidies, and that vocational training institutions should be encouraged to offer courses that meet the needs of disadvantaged groups through incentives or subsidies, build a labor bank that meets the job-seeking needs of disadvantaged groups, provide incentives to non-governmental organizations that employ the above-mentioned disadvantaged groups, and conduct follow-up follow-up on the adaptation status of disadvantaged groups after employment. Medical care for homeless people: The current law does not provide enough protection for the physical health care of homeless people, and there is no systematic research and treatment for homeless people's psychological problems. Therefore, we advocate that legislation requires resettlement agencies to establish a psychological counselor system and provide subsidies for this.

It is stipulated that parking is prohibited, and the police cannot issue tickets for parking in their own arcades.

In the absence of planned sidewalks and vehicles stopping on the side of the road, pedestrians and cars will fight for the road, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk, and many traffic accidents are prone to occur. Suggestions: Road planning should be equipped with sidewalks. Heavier penalties for occupying sidewalks.', 'Give me back real sidewalks: push roads to enforce physical sidewalks while improving the design of marked sidewalks""Marked sidewalk"" refers to the sidewalk marked with paint, which is different from the physical sidewalk. The biggest difference is that there is no height difference between it and the lane, and most of them have no barriers. The regulations only stipulate that sidewalks are ""road spaces exclusively for pedestrians"", and there is no clear timing for setting up physical or marked sidewalks. Therefore, there is no uniform standard for sidewalks in various places, which leads to many problems. Marked sidewalks lack physical barriers, are easily occupied by illegal parking, and cannot reduce the impact force in the event of a car accident. In addition, many marked walkways fall short of the Home Office\'s recommended width of 1.5m, or even the minimum required width of 0.9m. Moreover, the marked sidewalk lacks an overall plan, and it is easy to have a height difference due to roadside drainage, and there will be obstacles such as street lamps and transformer boxes. In addition, the painted pavement is easy to peel off, making it uneven and increasing the follow-up maintenance cost. Pedestrians would rather take the risk of walking to the driveway than use a marked sidewalk for a variety of reasons. Aiming at the above problems, we have some suggestions: Ministry of Interior Construction Administration: The physical sidewalks shall be legalized, and the timing of setting up various types of sidewalks shall be specified. In the regulations, only 12m is used as the boundary of whether to set up sidewalks, and the form of sidewalks is not limited to entities or markings. The safety of marked sidewalks is lower than that of physical sidewalks. Therefore, it should be stipulated in laws and regulations that there should be physical sidewalks in all road configurations, and the timing and principles for setting up physical and marked sidewalks should also be stipulated separately. Marked sidewalks can only be designated in roadways where the conditions are not sufficient to set up physical sidewalks, or only as temporary facilities, to avoid excessive use of marked sidewalks, regardless of pedestrian safety. Barrier-free and physical separation facilities are required for marked sidewalks. In order to allow everyone to use the road fairly, the following should also be considered when constructing marked sidewalks: smooth road surface, so that wheelchairs and baby carriages can be pushed on it smoothly; set up physical separation to protect pedestrians from being hit by cars; set up blind guide facilities to allow visually impaired people to identify sidewalks. As the roadway is too narrow, it is not suitable to set up physical separation facilities. The marked sidewalk should be regarded as a permanent solution, and barrier-free facilities should be added and traffic quiet areas should be provided. For roads that are sufficient to set up physical sidewalks but have not been set up, marked sidewalks should be materialized within a time limit, and barrier-free and physical separation facilities should be added to marked sidewalks during the transition period. The Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior: Strengthen law enforcement and education related to sidewalks. The police should list marked sidewalks as one of the key publicity projects to strengthen the public\'s concept of sidewalks and respect and awareness of pedestrians\' right of way. It is the duty of the police to enforce the law and ban illegal parking to protect the safety of pedestrians. Therefore, the police should strengthen law enforcement efforts to ban illegal parking on the sidewalk. The General Administration of Highways of the Ministry of Communications: Make prospective drivers aware of the importance of pedestrian right of way Road safety lectures and written tests should include content related to sidewalks and pedestrian right of way, educate the public on how to park in the correct place, manage from the source, and let prospective drivers recognize the importance of pedestrian right of way.', 'Reduction of lanes and shoulders, widening for sidewalks and bike lanesMany places in Taiwan\'s urban areas have continuously widened the width of the lanes to ease the traffic flow. However, the continuous widening did not help to relieve the traffic flow. Instead, it caused more ""one-person cars"" to occupy the road space and a more casual parking attitude. Wider lanes also compress the original small sidewalks and bicycle lanes. The people-oriented society disappears, causing many mobility assistance vehicles to drive on the lanes and people with disabilities walking on the sidewalks will be stuck by the transformer box. Suggestions: 1. Reduce the number of lanes and widen the sidewalks. The sidewalks can transport the most people per unit area. Driving, and wider sidewalks can also protect the right of vulnerable pedestrians to pass, especially as the proportion of middle-aged and elderly people increases, more and safer sidewalks are needed. 2. Reduce the shoulders of general roads. In addition to the fact that the shoulders of general provincial roads and line roads are not necessary, they often become places for temporary parking of automobiles and motorcycles or for vendors to set up stalls, indirectly causing safety concerns for passers-by.']"
