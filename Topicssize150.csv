However, the depth of each issue is not easy for the people to understand, which leads to the dissemination and dissemination of false information, which in turn affects the judgment of the people and the decision-making ability of the government. It is suggested that before (after) each policy policy, data collection, evaluation and analysis, domestic and foreign or generated data reporting, departmental decision-making and personnel (or two or more units) management examinations in charge of the proposal should be carried out. If there are problems before (after) implementation, FAQs should be produced and correct information published online, so as to facilitate the understanding and supervision of the public. The personnel and decision-making units of the units and decision-making units who put forward wrong information in the implementation and management examination shall be responsible (responsibility politics). In order to ensure that the information is accurate, the data is correct, and the source of the proposal is legitimate and complete. Only when every major issue can be rationally discussed and carried out in real operation can the country progress. (In order to avoid the continuous suspense of invalid discussions between different groups and people with different positions) The management and examination of major social public issues that have occurred should oblige all relevant units to solve and improve and track the progress of the investigation (investigation), and timely publish it on the Internet (without violating the principle of undisclosed investigation), so that the people can understand the attitude and method of the government's handling. Tracking progress is not the first to be raised by various planes, Internet media, and ordinary people. It is often seen that various media or people raise questions and issues earlier than government departments. This way, it can be expected to be resolved, and personnel at all levels will not have to bear the consequences because they dare not act or do not act. Suggestions on the platform for the online announcement and the method of inquiry, in order to improve the government's efficiency, such as the actual online announcement, so that the responsibility politics can be implemented. (Compared to the public hearings held due to the nature of the dispute, only a few people can understand it, and it is easier to achieve the people's right to know, and it is not easy to allow too many political parties and interest groups from all sides to get involved too deeply. Only when the people have sufficient information can they have the ability to judge and influence decision-making.)"", 'Long-term care 2.0 funding and manpower improvement plan_The long-term care system has been on the road for many years, and the long-term care system 2.0 was officially launched in 2017. However, although the long-term care system is planned in great detail, there are still two major problems to be solved in the long-term care system. The first problem, and the biggest problem, is the lack of funds. Compared with 1.0, 2.0 includes many more care recipients and requires more funds. However, the way we increase funds is to increase the tax rate of tobacco tax and inheritance tax. First, these financial sources are unstable. Second, the increase in tobacco tax and cigarette price will decrease the demand according to the theory of supply and demand. In fact, the final tax collected may not necessarily increase. In the past, some people proposed that long-term care be included in social insurance. However, once the insurance is compulsory, based on the mentality of not using it for nothing, it is difficult to guarantee that long-term care will not go bankrupt within a year like when the national health insurance was first launched. Although it is the government’s greatest ideal to take care of all those who need to be taken care of, the reality is that the fundamental reason why the long-term care fund has not gone bankrupt so far is due to poor publicity, so few people know that there is this social welfare, and they don’t know how to make good use of it. But how long this situation can last, the problem of insufficient funds will eventually surface. To this end, I think we can start from two aspects: First: the standard of partial burden ratio should be divided more finely, except for low- and middle-income households. People with ordinary status should set different standard of partial burden ratio according to the annual income of the family, and allow high-income earners to bear a higher proportion of partial burden. Second: Tax increase. Review the current tax rates. Compared with other countries in the world, my country’s business tax rate is indeed too low, only 5%. For example, Japan’s business tax rate is 8%, Vietnam and South Korea’s are 10%, and even China’s is as high as 17%. If calculated based on my country’s 2016 annual business tax revenue (3.85 trillion), as long as the tax rate is increased by 1%, tax revenue can be increased by about 77 billion, which will undoubtedly be a big help to long-term care funds. The second problem is the shortage of manpower. At present, there are about 130,000 people in my country who have a license to serve as caregivers, but only 2.60% of them are willing to actually take part in the service. Due to salary and general social perception, very few people are willing to take caretakers as their profession. The resulting manpower gap is bound to have a major impact on the entire long-term care system. To deal with this problem, it must be solved by increasing supply and reducing demand. Increase supply: 1. Improve the benefits of caregivers and strengthen their willingness to stay in the job. 2. Launch special training courses for caregivers for retired people to encourage retirees to invest in the field of long-term care. They may not need to be professional or have to obtain a license, but they can at least provide basic care services and social care, which can effectively fill the manpower gap in the long-term care system. Reducing demand: 1. Actively promote health activities and publicity, so that people can cultivate a healthy body. 2. Encourage retired people to participate in volunteer work or re-employment, so that they can continue to maintain a regular and meaningful life after retirement. In this way, they are less prone to obvious aging phenomena.', 'Advocate to revise the ""Civil Law"" and adjust the age limit for ""persons with capacity for conduct"" to 18 years old, so that young people in Beiyi have equal rights and responsibilities, connect with the world, and return rights to young people._Theme: To amend the outdated laws that imprisoned the autonomy and creativity of 18-year-old youths. This case advocates the revision of the ""Civil Law"" and lowers the age limit for ""persons with capacity for conduct"" to 18 years old. The rights, obligations, and responsibilities of humble young people are equal, and they are in line with the world to embrace the world and return rights to young people. Amendment of Articles 12 and 13 of the Civil Code, etc., and other related provisions. Explanation: 1. Due to inconsistent laws and regulations, the rights of young people are empty. There are currently 578,000 ""semi-adults"" between the ages of 18 and 20 in Taiwan. ""Semi-adults"" have the right to use public votes to participate in the decision of major national policies, and they must bear full criminal responsibility if they commit a crime. However, because they are under 20 years old, they are still considered minors in the ""Civil Law"". 2. It is the trend of the world to become an adult at the age of 18. Nowadays, with the development of network technology and the increasing popularity of mass media, the learning of knowledge and skills for young people is no longer limited to school education. With the flow of massive information, the ability to construct self-awareness is gradually enhanced. European countries successively completed the revision of the law in the 1970s. The United Kingdom amended the Family Law in 1969, lowering the age of majority from 21 to 18; France, after the adoption of Act No. 74-631 on July 5, 1974, which stipulated that 18 years of age was an adult, also amended Article 388 of the Civil Code to ""minors refer to individuals under the age of 18""; Germany amended Article 2 of the Civil Code in 1974, reducing the age of adulthood from 21 to 18. Even Japan, which has a relatively conservative social atmosphere, revised the 146-year-old ""Civil Code"" last year to reduce the age of majority to 18 years old, which will be officially implemented in 2022. After Japan amended the law, more than 130 laws had to be adjusted accordingly, but the Japanese government actively launched supporting measures to seek social support. For example, in recent years, the number of cases of defrauding young people has increased, and the Japanese government has announced the revision of the Consumer Contract Law, allowing victims aged 18 to 20 to cancel relevant contracts. 3. The current law was enacted 90 years ago and does not meet current social needs. Article 12 of the current Civil Law stipulates that a person is an adult at the age of 20. Article 13 stipulates that minors under the age of 7 have no capacity for conduct. After getting married at the age of 18, they will be regarded as persons with full capacity in civil law. The ""Civil Law"" was enacted in 1929. The age standard is to prevent minors from being deceived due to insufficient judgment or shouldering responsibilities that they cannot bear. However, 90 years ago, the space-time environment set ""adulthood"" as 20 years old, so that the current minors need to obtain the consent of their legal representatives to open bank accounts, purchase insurance, sign contracts and other legal acts, which does not meet the current social needs. 4. The Ninth Establishment Committee expressed its support for ""lowering the voting age."" The Legislative Yuan amended the ""Referendum Law"" in 2017, lowering the referendum age to 18 years old to encourage young people to participate in public affairs; in 2015, it discussed a constitutional amendment to give 18-year-old youth the right to vote, and all major political parties expressed their support. According to the results of last year\'s ""Today Weekly"" interview with all legislators, as many as 93% of the 64 interviewed legislators expressed their support for ""lowering the voting age."" 5. The civil law for adults at the age of 20 imprisoned the autonomy, creativity and entrepreneurial ability of 18-year-old youth. Palmer Luckey, a representative of American VR (virtual reality) technology, started designing VR headsets at the age of 16. At the age of 19, he raised 2.4 million US dollars from the public and founded the VR company Oculus. In 2014, at the age of 21, he sold the company to Facebook for $2 billion. In Taiwan, Tang Feng, the current political affairs member of the Executive Yuan, also started an Internet company when he was 16 years old. However, because the ""Company Law"" refers to the ""Civil Law"", it stipulates that ""persons without capacity"" under the age of 7 and ""persons with limited capacity"" between the ages of 7 and 20 are not allowed to serve as company managers, promoters and directors of joint stock companies. Tang Feng, who was underage at the time, could only appoint a family member as the person in charge of the company, and then participate in decision-making as an employee. 6. The 20 ban on electronic payments is also restricted. Taiwan\'s ""Civil Law"" restrictions on minors are not limited to entrepreneurship. In April of this year, the electronic payment institution ""Jiekou Payment"" was corrected by the Financial Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan due to a system setting error that allowed more than a thousand people under the age of 20 to open accounts without the consent of their legal representatives. Although legislators suggested that the electronic payment account limit is only 30,000 yuan, and that 18-year-olds can open accounts by themselves; however, Gu Lixiong, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, responded that before the age limit for ""persons with legal capacity"" in the ""Civil Law"" has not been lowered to 18 years old, legality is still controversial.']"

The affected families were as high as 20,000. Because Taiwan\'s criminal punishment for drunk driving licenses is too light, it creates a fluke mentality. Intentional homicide is ""the lightest ten years, the heaviest death penalty"". Compared with neighboring countries, China\'s criminal responsibility is relatively light. Therefore, incidents of drunk driving and accidents are common in the society. Therefore, it is proposed to modify the current criminal responsibility. Drunk driving offenders will have their driver\'s license suspended for 1 year; those who cause injuries due to accidents will have their driver\'s licenses suspended for 2 years; those who cause serious injuries or death due to accidents will have their driver\'s licenses revoked and will not be able to retake the test for life. Served for 6 months. If you refuse to accept an alcohol test, you will be fined NT$90,000 and your driver\'s license will be revoked within 3 years. The law should be revised to increase the fine to 200,000 and you will be detained for 1 month. It should be improved and you will not be allowed to take a driver\'s license within 5 years. According to the current regulations, if the alcohol concentration in the breath of a driver exceeds 0.25mg/L (or 0.05% alcohol concentration in the blood) and the driver violates this article, it constitutes a crime. A fine of less than 200,000 yuan. Transferred by the police to the procuratorate of the local court for investigation, according to Article 185-3 of the Criminal Law, if the ""fixed-term imprisonment"" is determined by the judicial judgment, the part of the fine for traffic violations is not required to pay, and the punishment of demerit points or suspension (cancellation) of the driver\'s license shall still be implemented, and road traffic safety lectures shall also be accepted. It should be punished with a fixed-term imprisonment of less than 2 years and a fine of less than 200,000 yuan. It should be revised and increased to a fixed-term imprisonment of less than 3 years and a fine of less than 300,000 yuan. In addition, it is proposed to increase the law to provide a tax plan for those who love to drink. Therefore, it is proposed to implement alcohol health donations.', 'Cancel the ""vehicle type split"" and change it to ""vehicle speed split"" (seven years have not improved much)_Taiwan\'s policy of car type diversion and purification of traffic flow was first formed in the 1967 year of the Republic of China, and it is now 111 years of the Republic of China. What is car type diversion? The diversion of vehicle types must be in a fully enclosed and simple route, and the change of the route will be restricted. For example, rail transportation such as trains, MRT, and high-speed rail are typical examples of the practical application of vehicle type diversion. The route has less interference from other interactive vehicles and has a high transportation coefficient. However, the disadvantage is that because it belongs to the exclusive right of way, other types of vehicles are prohibited from using it. However, our government has implemented the so-called ""semi-set vehicle type diversion"", that is to say, there is no so-called closed path, but it is implemented on the flat open road. The locomotives in the inner lane cannot turn left directly and have to wait to turn. When motorcycles drive in the outermost lane, they must compete with buses, taxis, and vehicles parked on the side of the road. Does this bring safety or harm to the motorcycle owners? There are also locomotive priority lanes. According to regulations, other vehicles and pedestrians are not allowed to enter, but other vehicles are not allowed to cross or occupy driving except for starting, preparing to stop, temporarily parking or turning. Also because of the implementation of the policy of splitting vehicle types, the phenomenon of classification and labeling of vehicles has been caused. Those who are restricted are regarded as inferior, just as cars are considered to be higher than motorcycles by default, but they do not know that motorcycles belong to the same level of transportation as cars in regulations. Suggestions 1. Cancel the lanes where motorcycles are prohibited. 2. Cancel the mandatory two-stage left turn. 3. In terms of education, strengthen the concept of giving way to pedestrians > bicycles > motorcycles > heavy machinery > small passenger cars > large buses. 4. Distinguish locomotives from slow cars (pedal bicycles, electric assisted bicycles, electric bicycles), and cancel the priority lane for locomotives. 5. Design road planning based on the concept of turning left to the left and turning right to the right. Refer to the project proposed in 107', ""Strongly request to amend the drunk driving law_The current laws and regulations impose too light penalties on drunk driving, resulting in frequent accidents caused by drunk driving, resulting in death and breaking up many families. According to the newly revised Drunk Driving Regulations, which will be on the road on July 1st, if the first offense of drunk driving has a breath-alcohol concentration of more than 0.15mg/l, or a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03% or more, a motorcycle driver will be fined 15,000-90,000 yuan; a car driver will be fined 30,000-120,000 yuan. In addition, those who refuse to be inspected or refused to be tested will be fined 180,000 yuan for the first time within 5 years, and 180,000 yuan will be added each time for more than 2 times within 5 years. However, I propose to increase the penalty based on the current alcohol test standards: 1. No matter whether the drunk driver caused an accident or not, once caught, he will be fined NT$1.5 million and his driver's license will be suspended for less than 3 years. 2. Drunk driving that causes injury, in addition to a fine of NT$300,000 to NT$2.5 million, will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 5 years but not more than 10 years, and the driver’s license will be suspended for less than 5 years. 4. In addition to a fine of more than NT$9 million for drunk driving causing death, the death penalty must be executed within 60 days to comfort the spirit of the deceased. 5. The penalty for drug driving is the same as that for drunk driving, and the penalty will be aggravated. 6. The standard value of the alcohol test is lowered due to the lower standard. 7. None of the above penalties shall be subject to a fine or parole. Remarks 1. Alcohol test standard value is based on government regulations. 2. The identification standards for wounds are based on the identification standards set by the government. 3. The current law does not have any penalties for drug driving. In addition to legal penalties, drug addicts should be punished in the same way as drunk drivers. Passengers are punished by sitting together""]"

To survive in Taiwanese society, the cultivation of English ability is indispensable. So how to include it in the curriculum of the Ministry of Education so that young people of this generation can use and learn English most efficiently. Primary school: School education should strive to be effective. Many students learn the English they really need or can use through extracurricular tutoring. The content taught in primary school is too small, which is easy to cause problems in transitioning to higher education. Junior high school: The content of the first grade is similar to that of elementary school, and it is much more difficult in the second to third grade (such as grammar, words, etc.). The distribution of time and teaching materials is uneven. This kind of learning is a bit like wasting a year of time to make learning English harder in the next two years. High school: The teaching materials are not consistent with the junior high school, and the difficulty has almost jumped a lot, which shows the problem of teaching material arrangement in elementary school and junior high school. Improvement methods: 1. Adjust the amount of words, for example, learn at least about 450 words in elementary schools, 3,000 in junior high schools, and 7,000 in high schools. Schools promote English spelling competitions, such as Spelling Bee. (This number is measured after reference and research) 2. Elementary school and junior high school textbooks are adjusted so that the difficulty does not jump too much. For example, the part of grammar teaching in elementary school is increased, and the first grade of junior high school is connected with elementary school, so as not to do redundant review as much as possible. 3. A lot of oral English is promoted in the course, which can be included in the examination content. 4. Arrange class English extracurricular books in the course, which can be matched with videos or experience reports, and replace part of the content of the homework textbooks. Even as texts, some life-like evaluations can be implemented on them, and reading skills can be enhanced through 1-2 books in a semester. 5. Try not to use complicated Chinese terms or proper nouns in grammar teaching, such as ""granting verbs"", which will easily confuse students and are not practical (after all, the communication is still in English). On the contrary, students should be taught the names of English terms, and more advanced ones can annotate English words in English to encourage students to think in English. This will not only make their memory deeper, but also train students\' English reading speed.', 'Oppose the Ministry of Education of the Executive Yuan to transfer national high school vocational schools to municipal education bureaus in accordance with the ""Senior High School Education Law"" and change them to municipal high school vocational schools._Oppose the Ministry of Education of the Executive Yuan to transfer national high school vocational schools to municipal education bureaus in accordance with the ""Senior High School Education Law"" and change them to municipal high school vocational schools. This year\'s New Year\'s Day, the Taichung City Government Education Bureau has incorporated a large number of national high school vocational schools transferred by the Ministry of Education of the Executive Yuan, and there have been many deficiencies that the city government cannot afford. Therefore, the Ministry of Education of the Executive Yuan should revoke this policy to the governments of municipalities that have not yet implemented it (Taoyuan City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, etc.), so as to avoid causing troubles to teachers, students and parents of students. The problems are as follows: Several principals pointed out that the selection method for principals has not been determined; the school fund cannot be used independently, and the Education Bureau needs to ""approve"" if it exceeds 300,000 yuan in the future, and a 15% matching fund must be self-compiled for major construction and teaching plans. Taichung City has taken over 17 national high schools with post-vocational problems. The number of underprivileged students in high schools has increased by nearly 13 times. The lunch subsidy for poor students is ""one city, two systems"". Students who are registered in Taichung City can only be free of charge. No subsidies are given to underprivileged students in Changhua and Nantou counties and cities. If the daily meal expenses are 40 to 45 yuan, the meal expenses for the first and second year students will be about 3,700 yuan per semester, and the third year will be 3,000 yuan. Based on the calculation of 200 poor high school students from other counties and cities, the annual budget will be about 1.5 million yuan. Some schools revealed that the Education Bureau does not have such a budget. Most of the national high school vocational students believe that there must be a lot of gaps in running the school after the restructuring. Students also pointed out that the entrance is national, but the name of the school printed on the diploma is the municipal school with the addition of national, so some students do not appreciate it. Facing this problem, Lin Qingbo, the principal of Wuling High School, said bluntly, ""I don\'t want to change the subordinate!"" The national high school\'s vocational reform to the city does not feel that the local government is ready, especially the Education Bureau\'s specialty is elementary and middle school education, and the high school vocational professionals are not enough, and the reform makes the teaching environment much more complicated. ""The mayor and councilors have become executives. How can school affairs run normally?"" This is the most worrying thing for schools at this stage. He also pointed out that the biggest difference in the transition from national high schools to municipal ones is the reduction in organizational structure, the inability to expand workers and staff, the lack of objectivity in the principal selection system, and the inability to adjust parents\' mentality and cognition, etc., which are worrying. Lin Qingbo also said that the Ministry of Education used to allow national high schools to develop inter-school characteristics. Once they are changed to municipalities, they will be restrained by the Education Bureau and the local civil society. He said bluntly, why the promotion of a municipality directly under the Central Government requires the full transfer of the national high school. There are also principals who believe that the staffing and funding sources will be the problems that will be faced after the transfer to the municipality. Although the Education Bureau and the school have talks to ensure that the rights and interests will not be damaged, there is no complete supporting measures, and the teachers are panicked. Taoyuan City will restructure national high schools and private high schools into municipal schools in 2018, and will pay more than 500 million yuan in response to the changes. However, there are still 14 expenses that have not been reached with the central government. Many councilors have asked the city government to clearly plan including the retirement of teaching staff and related benefits, and the school land after the reformation still belongs to the central government. City Councilor Yang Chaowei believes that the administrative staffing of municipal high schools is far inferior to that of national high schools. After the national high schools are incorporated, there may be one city, two systems. Municipal high schools are more worried about resource compression and should be properly planned. There is a big gap between the administrative staff of municipal high schools and national high schools. How will the Education Bureau plan to close the gap in the future? Will existing resources be compressed? Not only municipal high schools are worried, but national high schools are also in panic. However, the actual plans of the Ministry of Education and the governments of the municipalities directly under the Central Government are not available at present, and there are no relevant official documents.', ""It is suggested that the Ministry of Education resumes that students in schools below senior high school will be expelled from school if they have completed the three major demerits during their schooling._Only good character can have a good personality. Moral education and knowledge education should be cultivated from an early age, because this will affect the development of a person's life and the goals of future life. Therefore, education before high school is very important. Now students bully their classmates, have no respect for their elders, fight fiercely, and do whatever they want in school. The reason for the blame is that the school does not have an exit mechanism, just like the army does not have military law, which cannot achieve the function of effectively stopping. Today's students can't beat or scold, they like to listen or not to listen in class, and they like to write or not to write homework. Schools are not nursery schools. Kindergarten classes, teachers are not babysitters who have to help students to urinate. The teacher is the educator and the guide for the students. The guide of the road. Teachers, so preaching, teaching, and solving doubts. Now all ethics and morals are completely reversed, and teachers have no dignity and students are getting more and more tails, which is also the origin of all the current social chaos. Therefore, it is recommended that the Ministry of Education resume the treatment of students in schools below the senior high school who have completed the three major demerits during the school period. This will make the students fearful and eliminate a bunch of rat shit. Because now even if a student has been recorded with 300 major demerits, the school cannot let the student drop out, so the students will have the confidence to become dinosaur students one by one. Therefore, in order to allow students to study in a safe and fear-free campus, and teachers will not feel powerless, this proposal is made. Let the school return to a simple environment of studying and seeking knowledge, and let the students maintain a clean and pure heart.""]"

The calculation method of compensatory leave for overtime work should be handled in the same way as the calculation method of doubling overtime pay, such as multiplying by 1.33/1.66/2 times instead of 1:1 conversion. 2. The employer cannot limit the time limit for compensatory leave, otherwise the wages for extended working hours shall be arrested according to law. [Explanation] According to Article 24 of the current Labor Standards Law, only those employers who regulate the extension of labor hours, the wages for the extension of working hours shall be paid according to the standard (listed below). However, in order to save costs, employers often require workers to exchange compensatory leave instead of overtime pay, and even compensatory leave can only be exchanged at a rate of 1:1 (overtime work on holidays can only be exchanged for one day of compensatory leave on weekdays), which is completely unfair to workers. In addition, most employers will limit the use period of labor compensatory leave: for example, it must be used up within two months. Workers ""eat"" compensatory leave before they have used it up, and are not paid overtime pay in accordance with the law. However, in practice, if they want to ask for compensatory leave, they may be made things difficult by various factors or threatened with performance appraisals. The above-mentioned phenomenon has led to the laborers working hard overtime, but in the end they have nothing. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor should face up to this problem. I urge you to start amending the law as soon as possible, just like the amendment of a case, requiring that even if the labor and management agree to use compensatory leave in exchange for compensation for extended working hours, it should be handled in accordance with Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act and the multiplier calculation standard of related laws and regulations. For example: if you work overtime on holidays, the overtime pay is double, so the compensatory leave should be two days. (Currently only one day) Two hours before overtime work on weekdays, the catch repair should be multiplied by 1.33 to calculate, and from the third hour onwards, multiplied by 1.66 to calculate. Guo Fangyu, the former Minister of Labor, also said in the Legislative Yuan that it is unfair to replace overtime pay with compensatory leave and will review it in the near future. However, with the change of ministers, there is no change in overtime pay in proportion to compensatory leave. Please ask the Ministry of Labor to face up to this problem. Workers cannot be allowed to do meritorious deeds forever, but their hard work will not be worth compensatory rest. [Article 24 of the Labor Standards Act] 1. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than one-third of their daily hourly wages. 2. Those who extend their working hours within two hours shall be paid more than two-thirds of their daily hourly wages. 3. In accordance with Article 32, Paragraph 3, those who extend their working hours shall be paid double the daily hourly wages. If the employer makes the laborer work on the day of rest stipulated in Article 36, and the working time is less than two hours, the wage shall be paid an additional one and one-third of the normal hourly wage; if the worker continues to work after working for two hours, an additional one and two-thirds of the normal hourly wage shall be paid. For the calculation of the working hours and wages of the rest day mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if it is less than four hours, it shall be counted as four hours; if it exceeds four hours to less than eight hours, it shall be counted as eight hours; if it exceeds eight hours to less than twelve hours, it shall be counted as twelve hours.', 'It is suggested that the Ministry of Labor be renamed the Ministry of Resources and Labor. The head of the labor inspection unit is open to direct election or selection of workers. The calculation of compensatory leave shall be equivalent to the double calculation method of overtime pay._Controversy over the revision of the Labor Standards Act has continued recently. Less than a year after the new law was implemented, the ruling party wants to revise the Labor Standards Law again, but its position is completely different from the last time, and the restrictions on capital are greatly relaxed. In order to reflect and reward the Ministry of Labor for such drastic changes within a year, three proposals have been made. 1. The Ministry of Labor has changed its name to ""Ministry of Capital and Labor"" in recognition of its recent speeches and highlighting its core values. Regarding the controversy over the revision of the law, the Ministry of Labor has taken different positions within just one year. The same minister originally insisted that the current law is in the right direction and does not need to be amended. . The Labor Standards Act should be the most basic labor protection for workers, and the Ministry of Labor should be the highest administrative agency to protect labor safety. However, in the face of this hasty revision of the law, the Ministry of Labor has been unable to produce relevant research reports and data ""after the revision"". Labor scholars from all walks of life, members of the Law Committee of the Ministry of Labor, legislators, labor unions, and grassroots workers have been questioned about turning exceptions into general rules and treating general rules as exceptions. The Ministry of Labor has always said that ""it is necessary to give flexibility to the management"", ""it is impossible to report to you which industries have demand"" and other vague responses. This time, the Ministry of Labor demonstrated the law amendment hairpin turn for the people of the whole country. It is a typical top-to-bottom (Executive Director to the Minister of Labor), capital to labor, the boss orders the subordinates, and the subordinates cannot resist. Therefore, it is suggested that the Ministry of Labor be renamed the Ministry of Resources and Labor, so that it will be famous forever. 2. In order to be considerate of the management, the calculation method for overtime compensation should be calculated according to the multiple of overtime pay, so as to help the boss save water and electricity bills. Taiwan’s wages are too low, the working hours are too long, and labor conditions are not equal to negotiation between labor and management. In order to sympathize with the operating difficulties of Taiwan’s employers who often do not have enough funds to pay overtime pay according to law, we appeal again: the calculation method for compensatory leave for overtime work should be handled in the same way as the calculation method for extended working hours (multiply by 1.33, 1.66, etc.), rather than one-to-one calculation of unequal value. This move is not only fairer to the labor side, but also increases the reasonable number of compensatory days off for employees without going to the company, and can also help the employer save the company\'s utility bills. Such accumulation can make Taiwanese bosses more competitive and reduce the psychological burden of insufficient funds. 2. Referring to the appointment model of Lai Xiangling, the director of the Labor Bureau of Taipei City, the appointment and removal of the labor chiefs of the central ministries and committees is handled by the labor voting and selection model. If the labor chiefs, especially the labor inspection or labor safety units, have a basis of public opinion, they will have room to conduct ""reciprocal"" negotiations with their superiors instead of just doing meritorious deeds. Lai Xiangling, the director of the Taipei City Labor Bureau, is the best example. Therefore, the heads of labor inspection units and related agencies should allow workers (those with labor insurance qualifications) to vote and then select them, so as to represent the voice of workers and be responsible to workers. (You can refer to Lai Xiangling, Director of the Labor Bureau of Taipei City, at the beginning of the I-VOTING universal selection mechanism). [Repeat my three proposals] In recognition of the performance of the Ministry of Labor\'s amendment to the law, the Ministry of Labor was renamed the Ministry of Resources and Labor, and the name of the Ministry of Labor was encouraged and immortalized forever. The calculation method of overtime for compensatory leave should be calculated according to the calculation method of extended working hours (multiplied by 1.33, 1.66, etc.), instead of one-to-one calculation of unequal value, to help employers save water and electricity bills. The heads of labor inspection units and related agencies should be selected after open labor voting, so as to represent the voice of labor and be responsible to labor. (Refer to Lai Xiangling, Director of the Labor Bureau of Taipei City, at the beginning of the I-VOTING universal selection mechanism)', 'Labor law changes direction._A year ago, President Tsai revised the Labor Standards Act on behalf of the people on the basis of ""wage cost based on price"" and ""total control over working hours"". Although both employers and employees were unintentionally satisfied, they tried hard to adapt to it. Today, under the name of [Lai Shen] Wei, the dispute over the Labor Standards Law has been reopened, and the benefits have been greatly moved closer to the management. Whether it can last 12 consecutive days, or only need to take an eight-hour break between two shifts, it can be rescheduled again. The time limit is 138 hours in three months, which makes people feel that they are opening the door for the management. If the Labor Standards Law is to be amended, President Tsai\'s ""wage cost price system"" and ""working hours arrangement total control"" should be used. First, the calculation method of daily salary and monthly salary of full-time employees must be changed. The rule of monthly salary/30 is changed to monthly salary/22 to calculate the working day, so as to achieve President Tsai\'s ""wage cost price system"". In terms of overtime, maintain the regulation of at least four hours of overtime pay for overtime work on holidays. After four hours, overtime pay is calculated in hours. Since workers have to bear the cost of commuting time to work on holidays, the four primary units are used as the starting unit, and after four hours, the employer is given flexibility in calculating hours. In order to protect the rights and interests of both employers and employees, the following is the arrangement 1. The calculation method of daily salary and hourly salary of full-time employees is changed to monthly salary/22 days, daily salary/8. 2. Can work for 12 consecutive days, and the basic salary after 7 consecutive days*1.1. 3. Maintain the minimum overtime pay requirement of four hours for overtime work on holidays, and change it to hourly calculation for five to eight hours.']"

It is indeed a diplomatic way to deepen international friendship. However, the number of overseas immigration cases has increased recently, and the foreign epidemic situation is still severe. Considering the different degrees of the epidemic situation in various countries, my country currently does not implement border control, and a certain number of tourists enter the country every day, which is a foreseeable risk. Now, if foreigners are allowed to enter Taiwan for medical treatment again, will the risks mentioned above be increased? We don’t know yet, but we cannot take it lightly in the face of the epidemic. Taiwan’s current various retaliatory tourism and consumption are the result of the joint efforts of the command center and all the people in Taiwan.']"

It is well known that the power generation capacity of green energy is quite limited; Germany has excellent innate conditions to realize a non-nuclear homeland. Even if a non-nuclear homeland is achieved, Germany will still have to buy electricity from neighboring France, but France's industrial safety level is not as good as Germany's, and the risks know no borders. There are three or four nuclear power plants along the coast of Fujian, and the nuclear power plants in mainland China today are third-generation nuclear power plants built with advanced technologies from Europe and the United States. People in Taiwan are still wondering where the energy transition will go after the decommissioning of the first-generation nuclear power plants built in the 1960s. In fact, unlike Western Europe, Taiwan does not have a stable westerly wind belt, nor does it have abundant geothermal heat like New Zealand, but like Japan, the Kuroshio Current passes through the eastern sea. Instead of making good use of the Kuroshio Current, and adapting to offshore wind power and solar power generation, it is a matter of giving up the big and the small. We should strive for the transfer of Kuroshio power generation technology based on the US-Japan security treaty. If Nuclear Power Plant 4 cannot be trusted, and Nuclear Power Plant 1 and Nuclear Power Plant 2 will be decommissioned one after another, then the construction of Nuclear Power Plant 5 is imperative and requires strict supervision, financial and construction progress control, so as to make up for the vacancy in power generation after the decommissioning of old nuclear power plants. There have been frequent accidents in substations in recent days. National defense and industrial power consumption are critical to national security and national development. The public and the government should get rid of the algae reef thinking as soon as possible, and make a choice between striving for the transfer of Kuroshio power generation technology and actively building nuclear power plants. During the transition period of energy transformation, if there is concern about the air pollution caused by burning gas and coal, international waste gas filtration technology can be incorporated to try to reduce the impact on public health and environmental protection."", ""Please ask the government to come up with a reasonable argument, why not start up the new nuclear power plant No. 4, but start up the old No. 2 nuclear power plant that has been shut down for nearly two years?_After the maintenance was completed on May 16, 2016, the No. 2 unit of the No. 2 Nuclear Power Plant experienced a trip failure when it was parallelly connected to generate electricity, and it has been shut down for more than 600 days since then. The government keeps saying that we want a non-nuclear homeland and that nuclear energy should be replaced by green energy. However, various alternatives are either too late (the evaluation of various power generation methods takes time), or they are expensive (solar power generation equipment is expensive and have a short service life), or they are unrealistic (tidal power generation, ocean current power generation, or use love to generate electricity?), or they are serious pollution (coal-fired thermal power generation is the fastest way to make up for the current power shortage, but the whole world, including mainland China, is working hard to reduce this highly polluting power generation method. Taiwan has turned back and set Taiwan’s environmental protection back for 30 years, why don’t we simply burn wood to generate electricity?) Seeing that the peak of electricity consumption in summer is approaching, there is still no better way to solve the urgent need. The promise of abolishing the fourth nuclear power plant and establishing a non-nuclear homeland seems to remain unchanged, but the price is to restart the second nuclear power plant and restart the high-pollution coal-fired thermal power plant that has been shut down for more than 10 years. But isn't Nuclear Two nuclear energy? Is Core 2 any cleaner? Is nuclear 2 safer than nuclear 4? Is Core 2 newer than Core 4? Will restarting Core 2 be cheaper than launching a new Core 4? Please ask the government to think of some reasons that can convince the people of the country, and tell the people why the nuclear plant that spent 300 to 400 billion people's hard-earned money to build is not used. Instead of abolishing it, it restarts the old nuclear plant that has been in operation for 3 to 40 years. What is the reason for this? Even if it is impossible to abolish the nuclear power for a while, if it is necessary to use it as an emergency, it should be used to activate the new one and destroy the old one, right? This matter is like an old car that has been driven for 3 to 40 years and is about to rot, and insists on repairing it regardless of the cost, but it is as ridiculous as sending a new car that has not been driven for a day to the scrap yard to sell it as scrap iron!"", 'The counties and cities with the most votes for restarting the nuclear program should give priority to planning and building green cities with nuclear waste!_In response to the restart of Nuclear Power Plant 4, most of the focus is on whether the electricity is sufficient. Because Taiwanese people are accustomed to the consumption habit of ""eating as much as they want"", it is difficult to learn from countries that are also located in the earthquake zone, consider dismantling nuclear power to save electricity, or develop green energy. In addition, many people pay attention to the air pollution problem caused by thermal power generation. Is it decided based on public opinion that the counties and cities with the most votes for nuclear four-way restart should be prioritized for nuclear power generation-related waste disposal? Provide preferential benefits for electricity charges or related tax relief, etc., to create green counties and cities for nuclear waste? Set up a nuclear waste greening park and museum to introduce the development of nuclear energy to nuclear waste treatment, and then focus on nuclear waste greening for sightseeing, and also let the public understand the knowledge of nuclear power generation. Emphasize again that nuclear power generation is not bad. In response to economic development and electricity consumption for people’s livelihood, it is difficult for the government to implement energy-saving requirements for industrial electricity consumption, and it is also impossible to increase the amount of carbon emission tax. It is only due to the user payment mechanism. Just like previous news reports that residents do not want to be affected by electromagnetic waves, and thus opposed the construction of base stations, but later proposed that they would be willing to build base stations because it would affect the use of the Internet. If you want to use nuclear power to generate electricity, you have to accept the possible risks of nuclear power generation.']"

However, the Ministry of Finance announced that by the end of 2020, a total of 482,000 people in Taiwan owned non-self-occupied houses, and 1,747 of them owned more than ten houses (see Figure 2). It can be seen that the housing price problem in Taiwan urgently needs to be dealt with! But why is the housing price in Taiwan soaring every year? A big reason is that the central bank has implemented a low interest rate policy for a long time (see Figure 3). Some people will say that the low interest rate policy is not very good, it can encourage and make people more able to buy houses, but is this really the case? From (refer to Figure 4), we can see the trends of interest rates and housing prices in Taiwan over the past 50 years. It can be clearly seen that when interest rates are high, housing prices will naturally fall; on the contrary, when interest rates are low, housing prices cannot be kept high. Then why is this so? Some people will say that because the demand for housing becomes higher and there are more competitors, housing prices will naturally rise. But the author of the book ""Why Can\'t You Buy a House?"" puts forward a deeper view, which is the housing-financial feedback loop. (Refer to Figure 5) When people borrow housing loans, the debt burden of the people will increase, which in turn will lead to a decline in consumption power; and the decline in consumption power will lead to a decrease in the company\'s income. If the company has no money, business investment will decrease and labor will be paid low wages. In the end, laborers will borrow money because of low wages, and in the end, they will use debt to support debt, a vicious circle. And the most frightening thing is, do you think the economic prosperity created by high housing prices is real? As far as the society is concerned, there is actually no real production at all, and most people who earn ""economic rent"" from investing in real estate usually invest in real estate after making a lot of money, because they know that investing in real estate is sure to make money without losing money, with low risk and high return on investment. For example: in the United Kingdom, the GDP growth in the past 20 years has basically been the growth of land and housing, and there has been no real and productive wealth increase at all (see Figure 6). In other words, if Britain took away its land and houses, it would be an ultra-backward country at all. And the same situation happened in Taiwan. In recent years, the ratio of Taiwan\'s real estate loans to GDP has approached 50%, which means that all Taiwanese invest half of their money in real estate. In order to avoid the above situations, we must carry out financial reforms so that banks can shift their focus from housing loans to commercial loans. The easiest way is to raise interest rates! Because when money flows into enterprises, real production will be created; conversely, if money flows into real estate, housing prices will inevitably increase. This is the virtuous circle created by productive loans in the figure below. (Refer to Figure 7) Do you still remember how Taiwan, one of the four Asian tigers, created an economic miracle? Because at that time, Taiwan had credit control. The government would first set a GDP growth target before estimating the total amount of loans required, and at the same time use high interest rates to limit the rise in housing prices. (Refer to Figure 8) It can be seen from the figure that housing prices in Taiwan actually rose once in the 1970s, but then President Chiang Kai-shek raised interest rates significantly to curb housing prices. That is to say, the government intervened correctly at that time and allocated all bank loans to economic activities with real production, such as the construction of the top ten projects. In 1980, global banks were gradually privatized, and banks naturally preferred mortgages in order to pursue maximum benefits and minimum risks, which further led to the rise in housing prices. But we can look at Germany. The proportion of commercial loans in Germany is higher than that of housing loans. The big reason is that most of Germany is a ""stakeholder bank"", which uses long-term credit as the lending standard instead of housing as collateral, and stipulates that most commercial loans are given to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can carry out substantial economic production. It is also why Germany suffered little damage during the 2008 global financial tsunami, that is because most of their investments were real investments rather than real estate. In addition, there are two other ways to curb housing prices, here are a few additions: 1. Raise the tax on housing ownership (since it basically hurts the already wealthy people, it is harmless at all, but the personal income tax will further reduce people’s spending power. However, as Premier Su Zhenchang said, I am afraid that innocent people will be killed by mistake, and many politicians themselves are speculating in real estate. It may be a little difficult to collect taxes, but in fact there are still many ways to improve these points. It just depends on whether the government is willing to implement it.) 2. Build more public housing housing prices. From the point of view of investors, when it is more cost-effective to make other investments than buying a house, they will naturally invest in other things. But today, it is because investing in real estate and so on collects economic rents that they can make a steady profit without losing money. Therefore, investors can just invest in real estate without taking other risks at all. That is to say, the government should direct the country’s capital to production instead of real estate. To solve the problem of housing prices, it must first be clear that houses are for living. They are warm homes that everyone wants to have. To solve this problem, we must break the housing-finance feedback loop and move towards a better public society together. Reference: Xie Lina (translated) (2021).

Implement the spirit of returning prices to the public, fairness, and housing justice. 2. High-frequency transactions of short-term housing transactions, renting houses, increasing the tax rate, earmarking funds for special purposes, expanding investment in social housing construction, subsidizing the weak and maintenance. 3. Disconnect the rent of social housing from the market price, lease according to the standard and spirit of the announced land price, rather than the market price, and levy land value tax for investors/speculators, and tax based on the announced land price, especially for the disadvantaged and ordinary people. 4. Under the guise of returning to the market mechanism, investors are allowed to speculate, causing people to be unable to rent houses, and housing prices have risen to the point that people cannot afford them. This is the government\'s inaction and dereliction of duty. Residential justice is the responsibility of the government, not procrastination and grace. 5. Stop deceiving yourself by saying that real estate is a locomotive industry. There is not a single advanced country in the world that has developed through real estate speculation by the whole people. China\'s lessons and lessons learned from the past are right in front of us. 6. The construction of government public works is the construction invested by the people\'s tax money, and the results of regional development driven by it should be shared by the whole people, not as a tool for consortium builders to hype. Proposal content: 1. For the same natural person, their spouse, and minor children, who hold more than 2 ""self-use houses"" at the same time, and the holding period of the third or more households (including the third household) is within the following range, when considering the purchase, there will be renovation and related fees, so 100% taxation will not be imposed. Note 1: The house changer should not be considered, the house should not be held as an investment commodity, and the house change should not be used as an arbitrage. If the house changer is really self-occupied, he will not have the psychology of speculative arbitrage and expect to profit from it. Note 2: Purchases by non-natural persons should still be handled in the same way. Those who sell within 1-5 years are subject to 80% difference tax. Those who sell within 6-10 years are subject to 50% difference tax. Those who sell within 10-20 years are subject to 25% difference tax. Price tax must be registered and taxed at the real price at the time of purchase and sale. It is no longer levied at the announced land price, and the more households there are, the higher the tax rate, and the progressive tax rate is adopted. Note: The purchase by non-natural persons still needs to be handled by reference. If it is used as an internal staff dormitory, a certificate needs to be provided. If it violates the rules, it needs to be paid and fined. 3. If the same natural person, his/her spouse, and minor children hold more than 2 ""self-use residences"" at the same time, after the second household, banks are not allowed to undertake house purchase loans, and can only lend with credit loans. For each additional household, the loan interest rate adopts a progressive tax rate. 4. Restrict investment institutions, finance, and insurance companies from purchasing ""houses for self-use"" for investment purposes. 5. The above-mentioned income should be invested in the construction of social housing. At the same time, it should not be based on ""comparing with the rental market in the vicinity"", which will cause the rent of social housing to be unaffordable even for the weak. 6. Increase the scale of social housing, reduce the rent of social housing year by year in the future, and reduce the incentives and motivations for self-purchasing houses. At the same time, the unreasonable regulations that the rent of social housing will be increased year by year and the rent must be moved out after the expiration of the period will be cancelled.', ""Levy land hoard house tax to achieve average land rights_Purpose: The general direction is to control land prices. Individuals or legal persons should be controlled to hold a large number of land houses (houses basically include land), and hoard them to wait for the rise. Method: It is necessary to adjust the holding tax (land value tax, housing tax). It is better to sell than to collect rent or to increase the population share. Amendments: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on Equal Land Rights, local tax rates remain unchanged for self-occupiers, and multiplied for non-self-occupiers to bridge the gap between market prices and announced land prices. Additions: Housing Tax Regulations, Regulations on the Equalization of Land Titles, National Tax Collection, and tax bases will accumulate the total amount of tax bases reported by each locality, and set grades, thereby controlling the amount of land holdings. Personal concept formula: the owner's total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Conceptual formula of legal person: the owner’s total assets X-level tax rate, as long as the highest level is adjusted to rent is worse than sale, the average land rights per person can be achieved. Items that can be deducted (turnover, business tax, employee salaries, etc.) depend on how much tax this piece of land helps the government generate, or how many families it takes care of; then the individual case provides upstream and downstream relationships for review. Explanation: Is the country's construction land really not enough? The reason for the imbalance between the supply and demand of landed houses is that the cost of holding landed houses is very low. We all know that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone knows that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding landed houses. Everyone thinks that they can only buy and not sell. 1. Don’t plan for light holding tax of 3% and 5%. Of course, light tax is like boiling a frog in warm water. What I want is 5 times and 10 times the tax amount to bridge the gap between the market price and the announced land price. 2. Definition of house hoarding: The owner of the house has not registered, even if the house is vacant, it is also hoarding the house, and the unoccupied house tax must be paid. Charitable rental is an evil law set up to make these people hoard houses. One day it will not be a charity, so it is not called hoarding during this period? It is better for the government to impose heavy taxes to subsidize renters. Significantly increase the tax on non-self-occupied houses, and levy national taxes to subsidize disadvantaged renters according to the national overall progressive method. 3. Definition of hoarding land: Regardless of whether it is rezoning or buying and inheriting vacant land for construction, regardless of whether there are roads or parking lots and gas stations, etc., it cannot be used as land tax. As long as it is land for construction, it must pay land value tax. Setting up a parking lot seems to be very public welfare. When it turns back to the construction site one day, isn’t it called land hoarding during this period? Why not build a city plan to reward three-dimensional parking towers, or set up public parking lots when the land is rezoned. Substantially increase the land price tax for non-owner-occupied people, and levy national taxes to supplement military expenditures to defend the country in accordance with the overall progressive method throughout the country. 4. Returning prices to the public: The government takes care of the landlords in every possible way. Land rezoning changes, agricultural land has been converted into industrial land. Landlords don’t even think about how long they have broken the law. 5. Legal use: Industrial land is used to build houses, agricultural land is used to build factories, illegal use of land should be reported immediately and demolished, including industrial houses where collective housing has become a company share, air-raid shelter compartment rental, etc. are illegal. 6. The problem of land lease: The land should be used to build houses for people to live in, instead of using iron sheets to collect rent and continue hoarding the land. It is obviously residential land but it does not help housing at all. Land cannot be imported, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. 7. The problem of house rental: I live in a relatively small house and have enough room to rent others to collect rent. I shouldn’t buy more and more land and continue to collect rent. Do these people look at the rent of 2% or 3% in that year? Of course they look at the increase of 20% to 30% in the year. 8. Fish and meat rent collection: A large number of rent collectors who hold land and housing are equivalent to fish and meat villagers. Rent collection cannot create employment. 9. Reasonable rent collection: For example, the government plans to pay 30 per person, but I only use 20, or I only use 10 when I am wronged, and I have no objection to using the rest for rent collection. 10. Reasonable rent: the monthly rent for residential needs, it is stipulated that the total rental income of the leased object shall not be greater than the leased object (current value of the announced land + assessed current value of the house)/360; 360 months are calculated based on the building’s use for 30 years. 11. The government is required to set a date for the sunrise of land hoarding tax as soon as possible, so that financial real estate and other related industries can start to respond.""]"

However, the principle of necessity in the constitution allows murderers to escape the death penalty. Is this the reason why judges become murderers without the death penalty? Penalties for the mentally ill also have many injustices to the families of the victims. The law should be amended and amendments should be made to address these legal loopholes! Suggestions are as follows (bold text is the amendment): According to Article 271 of the Criminal Law, it should be changed to: murderer, death penalty Those who have already made a decision and will implement it within 2 months. If a person with mental illness is diagnosed by a doctor as a mental illness, the death penalty may be exempted and his sentence may be changed to life imprisonment. And shall not be released on parole. The attempted offense of the preceding Paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in the first paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than ten years. According to Article 19 of the Criminal Law, it should be changed to read: Those who cannot recognize that their behavior is illegal or lack the ability to act according to their recognition due to mental disorders or other mental defects at the time of behavior, shall not be punished, but Article 271 of the Criminal Law does not apply. According to Article 87 of the Criminal Law, the content should be added: Anyone sentenced to Article 271 of the Criminal Law will be sent to a prison for mental illness. Establishment of a prison for mental illness: A prison for mental illness is set up to separate mentally ill patients who are sentenced to life imprisonment from ordinary criminals, and they can be punished accordingly. Mental illness prisons must have the same personnel form as ordinary prisons, and must have mental illness-related medical staff to enter to facilitate the treatment of mental illness criminals.', 'It is suggested to increase the penalty of some criminal law provisions so that the offender can receive a considerable punishment and avoid light sentences_Penalties in our country have always been criticized by the public for their light sentences. Although most of the blame is on the judges, the criminal law itself stipulates sentencing, and its provisions are inherently too light. For example, for homicide, if the judge considers a fixed-term imprisonment when making a decision, he can only choose between 10 and 15 years. If he serves 1/2 of the sentence, he will be released on parole. This often gives the public a feeling that ""killing people only needs to be imprisoned for five or six years."" Homicide is the deprivation of the life of another person and causes great pain to the family members of the deceased. It is the most serious crime. If the homicide is only punished for less than 10 years, it is also a serious violation of the principle of proportionality and does not conform to social justice. Therefore, it is suggested to amend it to a felony similar to homicide. The fixed-term imprisonment part can be sentenced to 25 years. Other crimes such as the crime of serious injury and other crimes of seriously killing other people\'s health should also be amended together. The content is as follows, and I hope that the people of the whole country can support this proposal! 1. Article 33 Original text: The main types of punishment are as follows: 1. Death penalty. 2. Life imprisonment. 3. Fixed-term imprisonment: not less than two months but not more than 15 years. However, in case of addition or subtraction, it may be reduced to less than two months, or added to twenty years. 4. Criminal detention: more than one day but less than 60 days. However, in case of aggravation, it may be extended to 120 days. 5. Fines: more than NT$1,000, calculated in hundred yuan. Suggested amendments: In the third paragraph, if the maximum principal punishment includes life imprisonment or more, the fixed-term imprisonment part may be sentenced to 25 years. Reasons: Originally, 15 years of life imprisonment was eligible for parole. After the amendment of the Criminal Law in 1994, life imprisonment must be 25 years before parole. However, the third paragraph of this article was not amended at the same time. This will cause the judge to judge that if the degree of guilt is between fixed-term imprisonment and life imprisonment, waiting 25 years for parole to life imprisonment seems too heavy, and only 15 years seems too light. And for murder, for example, if the judge considers a fixed-term imprisonment when making a decision, he can only choose between 10 and 15 years. If he serves 1/2 of the sentence, he will be released on parole. This often gives the public a feeling that ""killing people only needs to be imprisoned for six or seven years"", and has long been criticized by the society. Homicide is the deprivation of the life of another person and causes great pain to the family members of the deceased. It is the most serious crime. If the homicide is only punished for less than 10 years, it is also a serious violation of the principle of proportionality and does not conform to social justice. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the third paragraph to be similar to homicide. The fixed-term imprisonment part can be sentenced to 25 years. 2. Article 271 The original article: Whoever commits murder shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Suggested amendments: Murderers shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of more than thirteen years. The attempted offense in the preceding paragraph shall be punished, but Article 25 commutation shall not apply to those who cause serious injury. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Reason: This article is amended in conjunction with the third paragraph of Article 33. If the fixed-term imprisonment can be sentenced to 25 years, the minimum basic sentence should start from 13 years. Homicide directly deprives the life of others and also causes great grief to the family members of the deceased. Also, if an attempted homicide results in a serious injury, the serious injury will cause great inconvenience for the rest of the person\'s life, and cause the family members to bear the burden of care, causing great pain to the person and the family members, and causing serious damage to social medical resources. 3. Article 278 The original article: A person who causes serious injury to others shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than five years but not more than twelve years. A person who commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and thereby causes death shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than seven years. The attempted offense of Paragraph 1 shall be punished. Suggested amendments: Those who cause serious injuries to others shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than seven years. A person who commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and thereby causes death shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. The attempted offense of Paragraph 1 shall be punished. Reason: Serious injury causes great inconvenience for the rest of my life, and causes my family members to bear the burden of taking care of me. Both me and my family members suffer great pain, and cause great damage to social medical resources. The degree of malignancy is no less than that of homicide. This article has never been amended since the criminal law was enacted in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. However, in recent years, those who committed serious injury crimes in society used cruel methods, and their intensity and viciousness were more severe than in the past. As for the person who causes death, if he uses serious and cruel means to cause death, it is also recommended to increase the sentence to death. Therefore, this article should increase the criminal responsibility in due course so as to comply with the principles of social justice and proportionality.', 'Amendment to Article 271 of the Penal Code_Proposal content: There are very few sentences that actually carry the death penalty for homicide in Taiwan. In recent years, criminal cases in Taiwan have often been punished too much for mentally handicapped or other mentally handicapped persons, and medical evaluations cannot completely and correctly determine the condition, causing those who are willing to use other methods to evade the death penalty, causing strong dissatisfaction among the families and people of the victims! Suggested matters: Article 271 of the Criminal Law Whoever kills shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than ten years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime mentioned in Paragraph 1 shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years. Changed to Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Whoever kills people indiscriminately shall be sentenced to death. If the death penalty has been decided, it shall be executed within 7 days. Intentional homicide shall be punished with death or life imprisonment with no parole for 35 years and 35 years of social isolation. If the death penalty has been decided, it shall be executed within 30 days. Those who cause death by negligence shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of more than 7 years. If a person with mental illness is diagnosed by a doctor as a mental illness, the death penalty will be exempted, and the sentence will be commuted to 35 years in prison without parole, and they will be isolated from society for 35 years. The attempted offense of the preceding paragraph shall be punished. A person preparing to commit the crime of the first paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than seven years but not more than 20 years, and a person preparing to commit the crime of the second paragraph shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years.']"

Elections of regional legislators, mayors, county (city) chiefs, township (town, city) chiefs, and indigenous district chiefs shall be 20% of the total number of electors in each constituency. ============================ Some people say that there is no voting threshold to be elected is actually wrong, or that more than half of the votes must be voted in the election, which is wrong. In the same election, the election still needs to exceed 20% of the total number of electors in the district. What is an equal election, that is, the number of candidates in the district is equal to the number of people who should be elected. For example: the mayor of Kaohsiung should elect 1 candidate. If only 1 candidate is elected, his vote rate must still exceed 20% of the electors in the district to be considered elected. Municipalities directly under the central government did not have equal elections, but district chief elections did happen ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================', 'The Central Election Committee should hold a national political party and non-regional legislator\'s debate-style political opinion presentation_Contents of the main proposal: The Election and Strike Law should be amended to require the Election Committee to hold a public political opinion presentation meeting on the list of non-divided legislators proposed by each political party. January 2020 coincides with Taiwan\'s general election, which is the most active time for Taiwanese people to participate in politics. And every election, there are many candidates challenging each other, and the topics of political opinion presentations and debates will come to the fore. In addition, according to the Election and Strike Law, the Election Commission shall hold public political opinion presentations during the campaign period for the election of the President, Vice President, and public officials, and the candidates shall present their political opinions in person. However, only the national non-partitioned and overseas national legislature elections are excluded, and each political party has never held a public debate on its own non-partitioned list of legislators. Since the first national presidential election in 1996, the people of Taiwan have taken a crucial step to realize the dream of democratic politics through ballots. Elections are an important link in determining the direction of democratically elected government policies. In order to enhance the public’s understanding of candidates’ information, Article 45 of the Presidential Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law and Article 46 of the Public Servant Election and Recall Law stipulate that the Election Commission shall be obliged to hold public political opinions during the election of the President, Vice-President and regional legislators. It can be seen that bridging the policy information gap between the public and candidates is the goal that our government and legislative departments actively defend and guarantee. Regrettably, since 2008 when legislators were elected by regional legislators and non-regional legislators, only national non-regional legislators have been excluded from the scope of public political opinions, making it impossible for the public to understand the policy goals that the 34 future legislators intend to implement through policy presentations. The Election Research Quarterly, Volume 19, Issue 1, pointed out that the public\'s awareness and influence on the non-districted lists of political parties in the election of legislative councilors pointed out that more than 65% of Taiwanese people could not name any candidate in the non-divided lists of the two parties. Looking further, the list of legislators without division is often suspected of being handed over to the top of the party. If there were no political opinion presentations and debates for legislators from different regions, and political parties would take the initiative to explain the hidden meaning of their list, members of the list would be able to occupy high positions without external inspection. Moreover, when non-regional legislators with mediocre political rewards enter the Congress without inspection, not only the fairness of their actions will be questioned, but they may not be able to perform their functions as legislators, causing many problems in the operation of the Congress. Therefore, the Chinese Debate Promotion Association hopes to take advantage of the vigorous political participation during the election period to promote the concept of policy debates and political opinions, and expand it to the list of non-regional committee members, in order to make people have a deeper understanding and discussion of the list of non-regional legislators in addition to the hot presidential election and local voices of regional legislators, so as to facilitate the deepening of democratic politics. Therefore, this Council proposes that the Central Election Committee should hold a ""National Political Party and Undistricted Legislators Debate-style Political Opinion Presentation Conference"", inviting representatives of all political parties to discuss the value ranking of the non-districted legislators\' list and the political opinions of the whole party.', 'An electoral system in which anyone who has no money, or who does not want to join a political party, or who has difficulty passing the party\'s primary elections, can stand for election, and everyone has a chance of winning_5 Questions 1. Does the longer the election period, the more beneficial it is for ""those with huge funds and resources""? 2. The larger the investment, the easier it is for the funder to manipulate it behind the scenes, resulting in the problem of benefit transmission after the election? 3. Is ""support poll"" one of the root causes of election bribery, underground gambling, malicious attacks, abandonment of insurance, and manipulation of candidates by funders? 4. Is it easy to be taken out of context and distorted by promoting policies and ideas when running for election? 5. ""Candidate\'s character"", during the election period, is it difficult to judge right from wrong, and it is mostly smeared? -------------------------------------- 4 methods 1. ""Adopt two-stage voting"" 2. ""Shorten the election time"" (from registration to voting) 3. ""Polls only focus on issues, not candidates"" 4. ""Each political party can propose multiple candidates, and then combine votes"" (also applicable to non-party membership) ---------------------------------------------- The details are as follows Method 1: Adopt two-stage voting The first stage: first decide whether the ""incumbent"" can continue in office? (Yes or No) (If not, one month later, Proceed to the second stage) The second stage: elect the ""next"" to prevent the ""current"" from being unable to lose and accuse the opponent of voting. Avoiding the hostile relationship between ""current"" and ""candidates"" is conducive to subsequent handovers and allows new appointments to get started quickly. Avoid the ""incumbent"" holding on to the ruling resources and ""candidates"" duel, resulting in unfair competition. Organizations or media can investigate the satisfaction of the ""incumbent"" in ""normal times"", so that the public can discuss the results of governance at any time. Compete with yourself, not with others. ""Incumbents"" can focus on their own governance and reduce the time, energy and money consumption of competing with others. -------------------------------------------- Method 2: Shorten the election time (from registration to voting) •In an age of illiteracy and lack of information, candidates have to give speeches everywhere, which requires a long election time. •In an era of less illiteracy and the age of smart phones, candidates\' political opinions can be seen and heard in a short period of time. •Those who intend to stand for election can ""normally"" publicize their views and ideas on public policy to the public instead of publicizing after registration. • For ""social issues"" that need to be understood by the public, we should find ways to let the public know about them in normal times. (Arguing after the election is easy to be distorted, and often only ""issues that are easy to be manipulated"" are left) --------------------------------------------- Method 3: Polls only target issues, not candidates The reasons are as follows • ""Candidates"" will ""attack"" candidates with ""highest or close"" poll results • ""Candidate support"" will become the basis for election bribery and underground gambling (which constituency, how far behind, and how many people will be bribed) Question: What does ""support poll"" mean? (In the previous era, elections cost a lot of money, and donors and candidates conducted polls in order to know their chances of winning) (In the future era, for the public interest, to achieve fair elections, can the law be amended to restrict support polls?) -------------------------------------------------- Method 4: Each political party (including non-party affiliation) can launch multiple candidates. The more candidates there are, the more one-on-one duels can be avoided and social polarization can be avoided. The more candidates there are, the less control the donors have on the candidates. Avoid internal fighting, which is a great loss to any organization. It can truly reflect the number of votes won by the candidates, avoid the abandonment effect, and avoid the watermelon clinging to the big side. --------------------------------------------- Specific implementation method A ""gamified electronic voting method"" (the following is an example) 1. Electronic registration (day 1~4) Anyone who is willing to participate in the election can register as a ""candidate"". Method 1: The platform assists in fundraising for 3 days, those who meet the standard pay the fee, those who fail to reach the standard refund, and complete the registration (3rd day). Method 2: The candidates pay the fee themselves and complete the registration (4th day) 2. Publish the ""list of candidates & political views"" and let the ""candidates"" debate their ""political views"" online or record them into a video. The public can upload ""all kinds of creative and funny stickers, and short videos"" through the ""real name system"" to support or oppose a candidate. (Real-name uploading is used to avoid malicious slander and rumors from some people) (People can choose whether to see multiple stickers and short videos when voting) (Day 5~6) 3. Electronic voting (Day 7) Use a ""facemash-like"" method to conduct one-to-one comparisons to attract people\'s full and in-depth participation. Next to the candidate\'s name, list the main political views. (Click more, you can watch short videos made by candidates for 3~5 minutes, or you don’t need to click.) (Click more, you can see various stickers and short videos, or you don’t need to click.) When the voting time is over, the system will announce the voting results immediately. (Billing) 4. The system automatically merges the ""number of votes of a certain political party candidate"" into the ""highest vote-getter of this political party"". The system automatically merges the ""number of votes for candidates without party affiliation"" into the ""highest vote-getter without party affiliation"". (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the combined votes are not combined to the highest voters, but are evenly distributed to the top 3 highest voters) 5. The system announces the ""highest vote winner"" as the elected candidate. (If there are 3 candidates to be elected, the system will announce the ""top 3 high voters"" as the winners.)']"

The Animal Protection Law is full of contradictions and loopholes. For example: Article 6 of the Animal Protection Law stipulates that no animal shall be abused or harmed, but Article 12 does not restrict the slaughter of commercial animals and experimental animals. The slaughter process will definitely harm the animals themselves, so the two contradict each other. 2. The Animal Protection Law only gives special treatment to certain types of animals. The overall law only protects dogs, cats and other vertebrates that are raised or managed by humans. Other animals of the same level such as chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. can be slaughtered at will, and the law defines the category of ""economic animals"". Purpose to use or slaughter? Therefore, in terms of fairness, the so-called ""dogs, cats"" and other animals should also be listed as economic animals in order to comply with the equal treatment of all vertebrates. 3. Animals are not human beings and should not be protected by law. The purpose of the law is to adapt to the changes and developments of human society, that is, the law aims to regulate the maintenance and protection of human life, and the law emphasizes the justice, equality and objectivity of human society. The protection of animals is neither in line with social justice, nor is it for the purpose of protecting or regulating human life. 4. The animal protection law is not in line with the overall fairness. Many people think that ""abuse or even slaughter of pets such as cats and dogs"" is a very strange thing that should not be done, but don\'t forget that this is simply our inexplicable doting on pets. If pets should not be abused or even slaughtered, then chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and even other molluscs, arthropods (insects), or non-animal bacteria and viruses should also enjoy the same rights. After all, they are also ""life"" and should be respected. Why do people only prefer to protect them? What about animals that should be protected while ignoring the protection of other animals? This does not seem to be in line with overall fairness. Conclusion: My personal opinion is that the ""Animal Protection Law"" should be completely abolished, and the law as a whole is completely inconsistent with equality and the law is too subjective. Dogs, cats and other ""pets"" for human entertainment and companions enjoy more noble protection than other animals. Are economic animals and experimental animals not ""life"" and should not have the same protection? Besides, what is the so-called ""pet""? Animals raised or kept for entertainment or companionship? This is simply a preference and arrogance for a particular animal! And the law also specifically emphasizes ""dog"" and ""cat""... It\'s a subjective idea at all! Therefore, the Animal Protection Law should be abolished. Besides, animals should not have the same rights as humans. The whole law is simply spoiling pets and animals from a subjective point of view, and this law does not help human society at all!', 'Completely repeal the Animal Protection Act and any related animal welfare policies_The reasons for completely abolishing the Animal Protection Law are as follows: 1. The Animal Protection Law is full of contradictions and loopholes. For example: Article 6 of the Animal Protection Law stipulates that no animal shall be abused or harmed, but Article 12 does not restrict the slaughter of commercial animals and experimental animals. The slaughter process will definitely harm the animals themselves, so the two contradict each other. 2. The Animal Protection Law only gives special treatment to certain types of animals. The overall law only protects dogs, cats and other vertebrates that are raised or managed by humans. Other animals of the same level such as chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. can be slaughtered at will, and the law defines the category of ""economic animals"". Purpose to use or slaughter? Therefore, in terms of fairness, the so-called ""dogs, cats"" and other animals should also be listed as economic animals in order to comply with the equal treatment of all vertebrates. 3. Animals are not human beings and should not be protected by law. The purpose of the law is to adapt to the changes and developments of human society, that is, the law aims to regulate the maintenance and protection of human life, and the law emphasizes the justice, equality and objectivity of human society. The protection of animals is neither in line with social justice, nor is it for the purpose of protecting or regulating human life. 4. The animal protection law is not in line with the overall fairness. Many people think that ""abuse or even slaughter of pets such as cats and dogs"" is a very strange thing that should not be done, but don\'t forget that this is simply our inexplicable doting on pets. If pets should not be abused or even slaughtered, then chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, and even other molluscs, arthropods (insects), or non-animal bacteria and viruses should also enjoy the same rights. After all, they are also ""life"" and should be respected. Why do people only prefer to protect them? What about animals that should be protected while ignoring the protection of other animals? This does not seem to be in line with overall fairness. Conclusion: My personal opinion is that the ""Animal Protection Law"" should be completely abolished, and the law as a whole is completely inconsistent with equality and the law is too subjective. Dogs, cats and other ""pets"" for human entertainment and companions enjoy more noble protection than other animals. Are economic animals and experimental animals not ""life"" and should not have the same protection? Besides, what is the so-called ""pet""? Animals raised or kept for entertainment or companionship? This is simply a preference and arrogance for a particular animal! And the law also specifically emphasizes ""dog"" and ""cat""... It\'s a subjective idea at all! Therefore, the Animal Protection Law should be abolished. Besides, animals should not have the same rights as humans. The whole law is simply spoiling pets and animals from a subjective point of view, and this law does not help human society at all!', 'Adopt stray animals, subsidize neutering and a free animal health check_Background Reasons Taiwan\'s ""Zero Euthanasia for Stray Animals"" policy came into effect on February 4, 2017, and officially hit the road on February 6. Since then, all public animal shelters in Taiwan have banned the culling of dogs and cats. Although it is regarded as a major progress in Taiwan\'s animal protection movement, the adoption of such a policy lacks corresponding supporting measures, and may even bring greater harm and impact to animals. Because of zero euthanasia, people feel at ease in abandoning and raising animals, and no longer worry about whether they will be punished by God for doing so, so the number of stray animals will increase even more than before. Therefore, in order to reduce the density of animals in the shelters, the local government adopted the principle of ""precise capture"", that is, stray dogs can only be captured unless they have attacked or injured the facts and have been confirmed by the informant. The excessive reproduction of stray animals, coupled with the overcrowding of animal shelters, the accumulation of too many stray animals, the environment is dirty and unsightly, and the animals live in an uncomfortable way, which easily leads to the occurrence and infection of diseases. Proposal content After adopting a stray animal in a public shelter, the identity of the stray animal will be marked on the microchip of the pet. Pets with stray animal status, after being confirmed, can be neutered free of charge at the animal hospital, and have the opportunity to have a free animal health examination. Anyone who abandons the adopted animals at will will be verified based on the microchip and the pet owner will be fined.']"

Second-hand smoke is even more harmful."" The current ""Smoking Hazard Prevention Act"" in Taiwan does not effectively control tobacco hazards. Indulging smokers to smoke in non-smoking areas causes second-hand smoke to endanger the health of others and private areas are polluted by third-hand smoke, which cannot be cured. The proposal should be compared with the advanced country Iceland, based on scientific proof that smoking and second-hand smoke and third-hand smoke are harmful to the human body. Cigarettes should be regarded as carcinogens, and the government must control them. Cigarettes are classified as controlled drugs, and the sales target must be adults over the age of 20. Cigarettes can only be sold in pharmacies, and only smokers with valid medical certificates who have failed to quit smoking and cannot be treated can buy cigarettes in pharmacies. Public and private places must apply for approval to set up smoking areas, and limit the range of legal smoking areas for smokers. Cigarettes are classified as controlled drugs, and the sales targets must be adults over the age of 20. Only pharmacies can sell cigarettes, and only smokers with valid medical certificates can buy them', 'Held a public hearing on the revision of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes (smoke-free substitutes)_The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that one billion people will die from cigarettes in this century. Cigarettes kill more than 7 million people every year, of which more than 6 million people are due to direct use of cigarettes, and about 890,000 people are non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Overall, one person dies from smoking in less than 5 seconds. According to statistics from the National Health Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, about 27,000 people die from smoking in Taiwan every year, and one person dies from smoking every 20 minutes. Concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction and Prevention Proper taxation and regulation can help reduce health harm There are more than 7,000 chemical substances in cigarette smoke, of which 93 are carcinogenic and harmful substances, and 15 of them are listed as ""Class I carcinogens"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Experts from the Taiwan Tobacco Harm Reduction Initiative, the only one in the world that has obtained the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) smokeless tobacco certificate, said that smoking is harmful to health. If you can stop smoking, you should stop smoking. If you are smoking, the best way for your health is to quit smoking. However, for the large number of smokers who are unable to quit smoking or do not want to quit smoking, if the government can properly tax and regulate smoke-free substitutes, it will undoubtedly reduce the health damage caused by cigarettes to smokers, and at the same time greatly reduce the negative impact of second-hand smoke and cigarette butts on non-smokers and the environment. E-cigarettes, heating tobacco iQOS Reasonable regulation is the key. The 2020 World Health Organization European Branch e-cigarette report clearly pointed out that the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Engineering and the School of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control have all recognized the potential of e-cigarettes to improve public health. The WHO also emphasized that the government\'s reasonable regulation of e-cigarettes is the key. The goal is to minimize the consequences of the tobacco epidemic and continue to bring positive effects to public health. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent non-smokers, especially young people, from being exposed to nicotine, and fully consider the interests of smokers to find a balance in regulation. The US FDA allows the sale of heated cigarettes. Data show that it can reduce the risk of exposure to harmful substances. The US FDA approved the application for the sale of heated tobacco iQOS in the US in 2019. The US FDA stated that the data submitted by the industry shows that the use of licensed information to sell these specific products will help addicted adult smokers get rid of traditional combustion cigarettes and reduce smokers’ exposure to harmful chemicals on the premise that smokers completely switch to use. In addition, the U.S. FDA also agrees that the heated tobacco iQOS can be sold in the local market as a ""risk-modified tobacco product"" and can be labeled with promotional slogans such as ""reduce consumers\' exposure to harmful chemicals in cigarettes"".', 'Set up smoking rooms widely, and encourage people to smoke in the smoking rooms, so that non-smoking people can have clean air._Although Taiwan is currently committed to tobacco hazard control, the results are somewhat insufficient. Some people advocate a total ban on smoking, but we believe that if it is adopted, smokers will have nowhere to buy cigarettes, which will make the underground black market more serious, and even create a monopoly phenomenon in illegal tobacco factories, and will also cause strong opposition from smokers; and if the tobacco tax is raised, it will also have the opposite effect. Therefore, this case is put forward as a suggestion for tobacco hazard prevention and control policy: 1. Widely set up smoking rooms, smoking areas and ashtrays on the roads and public places: Cigarette butts are common on the streets of Taiwan because smoking can be done everywhere in Taiwan, and cigarette butts can be thrown everywhere on the streets. Therefore, smoking rooms should be widely set up in public places and on the roads, so that smokers do not have to go all the way to a specific smoking room to smoke. With this convenient measure for smokers, not only can the number of people smoking on the streets be greatly reduced, but also the citizens can have clean air. In addition, ashtrays should also be set up on the road to prevent smokers from throwing cigarette butts in the flowers and ditch beside the road, so as to beautify the city appearance. 2. Increase the penalties for smoking in non-smoking places, and strictly prohibit littering of cigarette butts, and encourage the public to report: Although there are regulations that prohibit smoking near schools and specific places, our observations show that there are not many people who violate the law, and many people even throw away cigarette butts after smoking. We believe that increasing penalties and strengthening crackdowns are the last line of defense for the public to self-discipline; and we encourage the public to report anonymously so that offenders cannot escape the law. 3. Strengthen publicity on tobacco hazard prevention among young children: It would be too late if tobacco hazard prevention and control were taught in the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school. At present, there are still many people in elementary and high schools who will illegally buy tobacco products, and the promotion at this time will not have much impact on them. I think that if the publicity is carried out from the first and second grades of elementary school or even kindergarten, the children can know the harm of smoking from an early age. In addition to kindergarten, family education is also a very important part. If both can be combined, it should play a great role in the prevention and control of smoking hazards. 4. Strengthen the ban on underage smokers and merchants that sell tobacco products to minors: Even though the regulations have clearly regulated related laws such as the Tobacco Hazards Law, there are still many merchants (grocery stores) who illegally sell tobacco products to minors for profit. The ban or prohibition of selling tobacco products in grocery stores should be strengthened. 5. Improve the design of the smoking room: an effective smoking room should not make the inside a gas chamber, and the design of the intake and exhaust ports can solve the problem and avoid the second-hand smoke inside from causing trouble to non-smokers. Studies have shown that the leakage of second-hand smoke can be as high as 60% when people enter and exit the smoking room. However, if the traditional sliding door is replaced by a parallel sliding automatic door, the leakage rate of the smoke flow to the non-smoking area can be reduced by about 77%. There are many other methods that are simple and easy to implement.']"

Please write down every word and sentence below. The reasons you gave are all the reasons I mentioned. Can it be regarded as the government’s involvement in media manipulation? Please give back to the people the power to watch cleanly! The content of the original proposal is attached below: I hope that the government will refer to the French law. Each candidate must have the same exposure rate in the news. If the news station keeps reporting on a specific candidate, the public will receive unequal information and it will be easy for the public to be manipulated. If the imbalance in media reports can be reported, the details may need to be discussed, but it is best if the system can be as fair as possible. Refer to the government’s response to the relevant proposals: Press Freedom and Press Self-Regulation, and the relevant explanations are as follows: 1. Since news editing is the people’s right to freedom of speech in the Constitution, the methods and contents of news editing and editing shall not be restricted or prohibited except in accordance with the law. 2. At present, the Executive Yuan has set up an instant news clarification zone to clarify controversial news. And when related incidents happened, the NCC’s approach (excerpted from Xintouhou News): According to the Satellite Radio and Television Law, when producing and broadcasting news and comments, the media should pay attention to fact-checking and the principles of fairness and fairness, but there are no corresponding penalties. Therefore, the NCC will not determine whether the TV station violated the law or not. ""Article 49 of the Public Official Election and Recall Law"" has relevant regulations. Therefore, based on the standpoint of administrative assistance, the NCC will send the news content of the two TV stations from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm on the 14th, a total of 7 hours, to the Central Election Committee based on the content of public complaints. The Central Election Committee will determine whether it violates the election recall law. I think the instant news clarification section is a very good idea, but busy modern people don’t have the time to check all the news one by one. The number of viewings is not proportional to the number of checks, and it is too time-consuming and manpower-consuming to censor the news of a specific time period every time it is reported, and the news outside the time period is not controlled. It should be corrected from the source, and the report should not be biased from the beginning, and the follow-up reporting and review standards can also be clearer and quickly save resources. If the media itself is already controlled by certain forces, then it is not called freedom of speech for the people!', 'If the media reports false information, those who are confirmed must be forced to play clarification information. (Not limited to radio, television and print media)_1. News media report false information, unverified information, and inappropriate information (such as hate speech, quoting controversial online articles, or intending to create a trend of public opinion, affecting people’s perception of government policies (including epidemic prevention policies)). In addition to being punished in accordance with applicable broadcasting and television regulations, broadcasting and television media operators are required to publish clarification and apology notices in conspicuous positions on their news media channels (as well as their network platforms and (community) pages and videos) for 24 hours, and take down false reports on their own. 2. Print and radio and television news media, and their online news platforms (including community and video platform pages), if they provide online message function, must clearly mark the message management regulations, regularly manage message content, clearly display complaints (reporting) and cooperate with the mechanism for accepting and deleting inappropriate messages to protect the rights and interests of readers. 3. As above, the online news platforms of the print and radio and television news media must clearly indicate the content and style of the report, such as editorials, editorial comments and current event reports, and indicate the actual names of the authors (reporters, critics) and principal persons in charge. If news reports are quoted on social media platforms (such as Facebook and ptt) for malicious purposes such as disseminating and manipulating false information, the media operators must inform the network platform operators to take down the Internet platform operators who have been confirmed (including user reports, social platform operators, and government notifications of inappropriate users) to take down quoted and reported false online articles, and read-only news message area content, so as to prevent the use of controversial reports as unscrupulous people and groups as a tool for disseminating and manipulating false information, and creating public opinion trends.', 'Suggestions on amendments to the Three Laws of Broadcasting and Television._Rationale Thank you for your proposal. At present, there is a ""proposal to prevent false information"" online, which is being seconded. In order to increase the capacity of seconding, please make more use of it. Therefore, this case will not enter the seconding. First of all: The focus of the proposal to prevent false information is to suggest that the government adopt three directions: supervising Internet platform operators to abide by self-discipline, regularly evaluating the management mechanism of Internet platforms, and preventing false information from being incorporated into the civil defense system. The main purpose of the proposal to amend the Three Laws on Broadcasting and TV is to prevent the broadcast media from reporting false or harmful news, and manipulating the volume of the media to violate news ethics. How does this relate to preventing false information on the Internet? Second: Discuss the article that other proposers are not approved: https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/446799f1-2d2c-406d-a32b-9165721633e4 Thank you for your proposal. 1. People\'s freedom of speech is ""protected to the maximum extent"" by the Constitution, which means that if restrictions must be imposed, the ""constitutional reservation principle"" should be followed, and the ""minimum administrative interference principle"" and ""judicial reservation principle"" should be adopted for the restriction of freedom. 2. The media is a check and balance force in addition to the three powers of the executive, legislative and judicial powers. The freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and dissemination. This right cannot be undermined by unilateral interference by the executive power, that is, the content of media broadcasts cannot be restricted by administrative measures. The government cannot pre-censor the content of media reports in any form and for any reason. Therefore, the case does not enter secondment. Here I would like to ask the government: Use the name of freedom of speech to gradually harm speech and the democratic system. Is this a part of the democratic system? This is why the concept of ""defensive democracy"" is very much needed in the Republic of China and the reason for reviewing and amending the law: spreading false information and hate speech to confuse and divide the masses. Even if they report to the police, the legal system can prevent such behavior. The government should rethink whether the existing mechanism is effective? (Detailed link to the case) https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/201910160118.aspx Democracy and freedom of speech do not mean that they can be unlimited. ""The freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and dissemination. This right cannot be violated by unilateral interference of administrative power, that is, the content of media broadcasts cannot be restricted by administrative measures. The government shall not pre-censor the content of media reports in any form and for any reason. In the face of the use of broadcast media to report false information and hype the volume in an attempt to influence and confuse people\'s right to listen, the government should take action and handle it according to law, because this is definitely not part of freedom of speech and should not be covered by the scope of protection. Finally, I re-propose the content: 1. The communication and communication business report network (defined as broadcast content) of the National Communications and Communications Commission website cooperates with a third-party verification organization. After the public reports the program content, it will be submitted to a third-party fact-checking organization for verification (during the verification period, the word ""fact-checking"" must be marked on a prominent place in the program). Those who are confirmed to be false information must be removed from the shelves and clarified within 24 hours, and the relevant units will be notified for investigation. 2. Regulate the radio and television media and their digital platforms to report news events, social issues and figures. The media exposure rate must be consistent, and prevent improper use of the media to manipulate the volume and confuse issues.']"
