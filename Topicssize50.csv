That is because of the wrong education system. In recent years, the system has been changed again and again, but it has not made it easier for high school students or to find their own expertise. Because the existing system cultivates a kind of examination machine, we should start from a new one. Self-examination, instead of making mistakes again and again, cultivate their own expertise, which is more useful than examination machines, but this is different from higher vocational education. Students in high school may not have found their own direction in life, so there should be various Various courses allow students to try, rather than being limited to the natural group or the social group. It seems that they can only choose one of the two groups in the future without making aspirations before high school. If students have set their ambitions in the first year of high school, it is useless to study and take exams non-stop in the second and third year of high school, and do things outside their interests. Letting students participate in competitions and activities to give full play to their strengths is more satisfying than non-stop exams. Students have self-confidence, these are more important."", ' Paperless tests in schools below high school_Background of the issue: At present, most of the examinations and tests in schools below high school in China are based on paper tests, which not only consume a lot of natural resources, but also have low reusability of test papers. Considering that this measure has a certain degree of burden on environmental protection and funds, it is proposed to implement paperless tests in schools at all levels below high school to achieve environmental protection and economic benefits. Current issues: 1. Environmental protection issues: The global warming is serious nowadays, and the reduction of forest area is a major reason. Papermaking is an industry that consumes a considerable amount of forest resources. According to the traditional way of cutting down trees to make paper, for every ton of paper to be produced, it is necessary to cut down twenty four Plant height approx. 12 meters, diameter approx. 15 to 20cm trees. In addition to the consumption of raw materials and tree resources, papermaking also consumes a lot of energy, including a large amount of water, electricity and fuel. Not only does it consume a lot of energy, but its manufacturing process also causes a certain degree of pollution, such as sewage discharge and coal-fired waste gas discharge. . Improper deforestation not only consumes resources and energy, but also causes irreversible damage to the ecology. If the use of paper can be reduced, the negative impact on the environment can be greatly reduced and sustainable development can be promoted. 2. Economic issues: Nowadays, public schools at all levels below high school mostly use paper-based tests, and the same is true for tests at the national level. The accumulated paper resources consumed by these examinations are quite large, and the expenditures consumed by purchasing these papers are also considerable. In addition, the price of pulp has been rising repeatedly in recent years, so the cost of betting on paper will only increase again and again in the future. These costs are calculated into the national taxes and are ultimately borne by the whole people. Therefore, if the cost of paper consumption can be reduced, these taxes can be better invested and used in other fields. Related cases: 1. Manipal Universityexist 2017 Year 9 The new semester begins to include tablets in exams, a digital initiative that will help the university save 300 10,000 copies of paper, and the launch of the new system at that time also attracted some universities in Bangalore to follow up, such as PES University as well as Maharani Lakshmi Ammanni College for Women . These devices also use new screens, which allow students to write in a similar way to writing on paper, and reduce the light to protect students\' eyes. To prevent cheating, the screen also limits the students\' perspective. 2.AP take an exam (Advanced Placement) yes College Board ( that is SAT The question institution ) Created a system of advanced university courses that allow students to take pre-university courses in high school. pass AP After the exam, it can be redeemed for university credits, which is also helpful for future university education. It can get twice the result with half the effort compared with other students, and is more familiar with the course content. College Board updated 2021 YearAP Changes in the exam, providing an online exam that includes all knowledge points, and the school will arrange or authorize students to take the exam at home. Online exams will be administered on a computer, not on a mobile phone or tablet. Whether at school or at home, all online exams will be fair and safe. For example: students taking online exams will not be able to return to answered questions, or return or jump to unanswered questions, online exams will start at the same global time, etc. 3. USA NCLEX-RN( Registered Nurse License ) exam since 1994 Year 4 Since January, the traditional paper-and-pencil method has been changed to a computer-based test ( Computerized Adaptive Test , referred to as CAT ) and unified across the country.

But since 2005 Year 1Months later, non-US or territorial exams can be chosen. The computer can judge and adjust the level of the test questions at any time according to the candidates\' responses to the questions. There are multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, Lianliankan and picture questions and other diverse question types. 4.

In the past, due to the need to review drawings, the paper illustrations were copied many times, which was inefficient and not environmentally friendly. Paper-based review can also lead to non-transparent processes and delays in review progress. Today, the construction license is changed to paperless. In addition to energy saving and environmental protection, it can also improve administrative efficiency and service quality. ? specific plan: 1. Electronic test: Change the currently used physical test paper test method to electronic test paper, and conduct the test electronically. Since there are many successful cases of electronic tests at home and abroad, this form does not have too many technical problems. And we plan to use tablets and computers for students to use, learn from successful experience abroad, and lower the maximum brightness of the equipment to protect students\' eyes. In addition, a monitoring system is also established so that the teacher\'s computer can display the screen images of all the students at the same time, so as to prevent students from querying the answers. This objective is the main objective of this agenda item. 2.Replace the test with other scoring methods: In addition to the test paper test, other scoring methods can be used as the evaluation standard for students. For example, through the analysis of research reports and the publication of project results, not only the purpose of paperless testing can be achieved, but also the old cramming education testing method can be changed, and students\' learning outcomes can be tested in a more flexible form. 3. Seeking for more environmentally friendly paper alternatives: If there is a reason why paperless can not be implemented at this stage, you can still consider using more environmentally friendly recycled paper or unbleached paper, which can be purchased in bulk by the state or schools from manufacturers. On the one hand, it can be used as a A more environmentally friendly alternative, on the other hand, can also support recycled paper manufacturers, allowing the domestic paper industry to develop towards environmentally friendly recycled paper manufacturing. Expected Benefits and Impacts: 1. Reduce the use of paper resources to achieve the benefits of environmental protection. 2.Economically, reduce the expenditure of one-time resources, and use the budget for paper expenses on other expenses, or invest in other non-disposable supplies, such as the purchase of electronic products, etc. On the school side, the cost of printer consumables for printing test papers can be reduced; on the student side, the cost of stationery consumption can be reduced. 3. Online testing can reduce the manpower required for printing and reviewing test papers, greatly reducing the labor cost of testing, and achieving more effective use of human resources. 4. It can greatly reduce the situation of test writing or marking unclear, dirty answer cards, etc., and avoid disputes in test marking. 5. Electronic tests can greatly improve the efficiency of answering. For exams with complex answering methods such as application questions, students can also submit answers more efficiently and completely, making the answering method more user-friendly. 6.The online test has multiple functions, such as random test papers, random questions and options, and different test papers, which not only increases the diversity of test questions, but also reduces the possibility of students cheating, making the test more flexible to match Accurately achieve the measurement target. 7. Comply with international trends, so that students and administrative units can adapt to paperless tests and operating applications in advance, so as to connect with modern working models. Program goals: Short-term goals: 1.Develop, design and test paperless test software: Design a test system, assign some classes and classrooms to use the system for class quizzes, and make system corrections after evaluating its use status. In the early stage, the school used the existing computer classroom equipment and chose simpler test types such as multiple-choice questions. On the one hand, the structured system gradually matures to meet the needs of comprehensive tests in the future, and on the other hand, it also makes teachers and students familiar with the mode of online tests. Schools can start with subjects that are easier to implement, such as judgment-style multiple-choice questions such as Chinese and social studies. For questions that require little or no calculation, they can use the computer options to directly select and fill in the answers, and conduct electronic examinations. 2.Gradually change the traditional paper-and-pencil test method as a buffer for paperless tests: When schools evaluate students, they gradually reduce the use of paper-and-pencil tests for entrance examination subjects. For the needs of other different subjects such as Arts and Sciences, other assessment methods are used to calculate the results. For example: briefing report, sorting out key points in class, handing in class experience...etc. On the one hand, the traditional paper-and-pencil test can be reduced, and on the other hand, it can also re-examine whether the original test should be revised, so as to find the most suitable test method for each subject. 3. Teaching cooperation policy: Before the proportion of paperless examinations increases, schools can also strengthen the promotion of students\' Chinese and English typing skills, so as to facilitate the fluency of answering in the time limit of subsequent electronic examinations. In addition, it is also possible to strengthen the training of students to familiarize themselves with the basic functions of the computer during class, so as to protect the rights and interests of students during the paperless test. 4. prevent cheating :In order to prevent students from cheating during the exam, the teacher monitoring system is still immature. We order the test questions for each student in a different order, and hope that the school can add partitions between the seats to prevent the suspicion of melon fields and plums. Medium-term Goal: 1. Adaptively adjust the proportion of paperless subjects: After students adapt to the computer-based test format, gradually increase the proportion of subjects that require keyboard input. For example: in terms of the difficulty level of the input method, first add the mathematics subject that mainly focuses on simple number input, then gradually add the more complex Chinese language composition of Zhuyin and Pinyin input, and finally add the second language English, etc., so that students can One by one paperless tests adapted to different nature of examinations. 2.Use environmentally friendly paper to supply irreplaceable paper usage needs: When there are unavoidable or difficult to replace paper needs, such as: elementary school test questions on the spelling and spelling of phonetic Chinese characters or school-age children who do not yet have the ability to use computers, complex mathematics For descriptive questions such as the process of physical and chemical calculations and mathematics proof questions in junior high schools, the Ministry of Education or schools at all levels negotiate with manufacturers to purchase environmentally friendly paper, such as recycled paper or unbleached paper, at a price relatively lower than the market price. paper, etc., so that the inevitable use of paper can not lose the spirit of environmental protection; I hope to use this to bring about the trend of using environmentally friendly paper, blow the whirlwind of environmentally friendly papermaking from the industry, and also look forward to attracting jade through For example, environmental protection starts with education, and arouses the attention of the people to environmental protection in order to achieve a win-win situation. 3. Upgrade of hardware and software equipment: In terms of hardware, the purchase is enough for all grades ( lower, middle and upper grades )The hardware equipment used to conduct the test alternately, such as computers, tablet computers, etc.; the software level is to complete the test system and upgrade the computer bandwidth year by year to facilitate the confidentiality of the test questions and the fluency of the test. In addition, a set of switching screen alerts that can be automatically identified by the system will also be developed to automatically detect whether students are taking the test on this page, so as to prevent students from cheating during the answering process, so that the paperless test has enough supporting measures to implement the spirit of fairness and justice. Long-term goals: 1. Improve the test system and widely apply paperless tests to various subjects: Concentrate the successful experience of paperless tests in various subjects in the past to facilitate regular updates and corrections of the paperless test platform and ensure that the encryption function of the system is safe; At the same time, the platform has been upgraded to a processing page, and it is impossible to leave halfway through the test. Once you try to open the sub-page by any means, the test will be terminated directly. At the same time, the school will also try its best to promote the examination of all subjects in the form of paperless tests, so as to achieve an educational ecological environment dominated by paperless tests. 2.Improve the functions of software and hardware equipment to the extent that it can cooperate with the comprehensive paperless test mode: In terms of software, integrate digital teaching resources and c\nloudify existing application systems, aiming at network bandwidth improvement, resource integration, information security protection and The learning service platform proposes an action plan. In addition, the professional teams and talents of the county and city governments are used to provide resources, operate and maintain operations, and conduct research on digital content. The hardware resources are provided by the school, so that each student has a personal test-taking device, such as a tablet. Additional quizzes for other special needs ( such as handwriting ) , you can introduce devices such as handwriting boards to make the test fully paperless. 3.Popularization of paperless test mode, average educational resources: resources are provided by the school, and for areas with poor resources, the government provides additional financial subsidies to increase the popularity of digital learning resources and make paperless tests a part of education for all. The universal model can reduce the resource gap between urban and rural areas and the occurrence of inadaptability. Conclusion: Looking at the application of paperless at different academic levels at home and abroad, we can see that paperless is an inevitable process no matter in the field of academic education or in the operation of company teams. Although this means a change in usage patterns and a huge expense, the practice of environmental protection and modern innovation is worth the investment. Combining the advantages mentioned in this proposal, we can see that the advantages of the paperless test policy obviously outweigh the disadvantages. It can not only implement the concept of environmental protection, slow down global warming, but also achieve the prospect of improving the quality of life, and even for future national competition Force is also a big help. ?

However, a few years after the amendment, there is still no special area in Taiwan. However, it is not without voices from all over the country to set up special districts. For example, in the Changhua County Council No. 19 During the third regular meeting of the session, the councilors proposed to the county government to draw up regulations on the autonomy of special areas, and the final resolution of the assembly was sent to the county government for study and implementation. After investigation and follow-up by the team, the case of formulating the autonomous regulations of special regions was handed over to the Economic and Green Energy Development Office for drafting. However, if you ask about the progress afterwards, you have to respond with prevarications such as simple and conservative folk customs, complicated management, and no willingness to invest, or Dongshi Township in Yunlin 2012In 2010, through the resolution of the representatives of the villagers, they unanimously approved the establishment of a sex zone and petitioned the Yunlin county government. However, the county government responded that it was not suitable to set up a sex zone. Opinion surveys on government measures have shown that more than three-quarters of our people believe that limited liberalization of industries is possible. And there have been too many cases of local and central parties playing football with each other. On the public policy network participation platform and the Taipei City Government i-Voting In the online voting system, many congressmen and civil society organizations have repeatedly voted for the establishment of a special zone. However, the national public policy online participation platform responded that this is the authority of the local government. The Taipei City Government i-VotingThe online voting system dismissed the relevant proposals as a national unified matter. Even the government itself did not know what authority the agency had, and just shirked responsibility. The government\'s attitude towards the sex industry is evident. However, the country cannot be an ostrich, burying its head in the ground when it sees a problem. The reason why the promotion of the sex industry has great resistance is because the sex industry itself may have a certain degree of external costs, such as a bad image of the community, lower housing prices, worsening public security, Dirty environment, etc., but many empirical studies have shown that if a good control policy is matched, the external cost of the area where the sex zone is set up may be lower than the punishment for prostitution. The reason why residents misunderstand it is that Because the media has framed the society’s established impression of sex workers, residents will take excessive defensive measures based on the exaggerated worst-case scenario reported by the media, and be restrained by such biased cognition, which will also shape The more intense the NIMBY effect, coupled with the mystification of China\'s sex industry under the government\'s active suppression for a long time, and when the public knows less about the subject matter, or the probability of accidents is unknown, the sense of threat will be amplified. Of course, the resistance to setting up a special zone will be greater. However, the situation of biased cognition is usually not true. To solve the biased cognition, it is necessary to solve the problem of residents’ information inequality. Deliberative democracy emphasizes “discussion” and complements the link of public discussion that is lacking in traditional democratic politics. Institutional means create a field for the public to understand public issues, and enable democratic politics to shift from traditional majority voting to consensus voting with more sufficient discussion and debate. This not only deepens the grassroots democratic system, but also enables more diverse imaginations in policies. . The reason why deliberative democracy can solve the NIMBY effect in sexual zones will be discussed in the following: 1. Risk communication uses communication skills to allow surrounding residents to understand disgusting facilities and related impacts. In traditional risk communication theory, it should Focusing on experts conveying the truth, while advocating public education and technical rationality, this one-way communication lacks awareness of risks and their social context, and is not adopted by the academic community. The current mainstream risk communication theory is mainly to solve In addition to professional-related issues, we should pay more attention to the risks related to property depreciation and quality of life, and the importance of information related to facility needs. Generally speaking, information transparency and how technology is used by the public can greatly improve Improve the effect of risk communication, and then affect residents\' acceptance of NIMBY facilities. 2. Consensus building Site selection through a democratic consultation process can potentially allow stakeholders to consider different possibilities and the legitimacy of these options, promote the participants\' sense of self-determination, and may also allow more Many support monetary compensation. Through the process of building consensus, it can not only reduce the frustration associated with risky decision-making, but also reduce the animosity of both sides of the negotiation, and it is also more efficient in terms of time and financial costs.? 3. Empowerment By empowering the people affected by the facilities, they can have channels to control these disgusting facilities and the impact of the facilities. 4. System reform ? Identify, establish, and use institutional structures to facilitate and maintain consistency and certainty in the siting process for offending facilities. The underlying assumption is that institutional reforms can not only address the uncertainties of the public, investors, builders, and policymakers in the siting of objectionable facilities. ?Since the sex industry is a social welfare facility, the direction to solve the NIMBY effect should be to reduce or eliminate the cause of NIMBY as the main direction, because the establishment or operation of social welfare facilities is related to the rights of facility users and wider public interests , is a decision that can be made after evaluation based on professional knowledge or technical experience. In the case that the installation or operation behavior does not necessarily cause risks to the living environment of residents, the reason for residents\' opposition may be due to personal bias in risk perception Either inherent prejudice, or simply a feeling of unfair distribution of responsibilities in the heart, so in order to understand the reasons for residents’ avoidance, it must be included in the residents’ consensus formation process, and the deliberative democratic consultation mechanism includes “risk communication” and “ Consensus building"" are two effective strategies, which are the best ways to avoid the NIMBY effect in the setting of exploratory special areas. To sum up, the Taipei City Government should actively hold a citizen meeting centered on the concept of deliberative democracy, gather residents, scholars, sex workers (including venue operators), government officials, etc., and discuss where to set up a sex zone , and set up control measures together, with the hope that through the power of civil society, the shady sex workers will not be forgotten again in the field of social issue discussions.?']"

Personally, I think you can refer to the way of the expressway, during rush hour (07~10 , 17~21) open large heavy locomotives have to drive on the shoulder. The elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue are ordinary roads. According to the court case, when vehicles are congested and stationary, large and heavy locomotives can split their lanes without violating the rules. But instead of increasing the collision risk of automobiles and motorcycles in this way, it is better to compare the long-established relief method of the expressway, and open large-scale heavy locomotives to drive on the shoulders of the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue during peak hours. Because the elevated road of Civic Avenue and the shoulder of Huandong Avenue are slightly narrow, cars cannot drive, but large and heavy locomotives can be effectively used. This can reduce the gap between hundreds of large and heavy locomotives and effectively use the road space. It can also quickly relieve the number of locomotives on the two elevated sections, which is believed to be a measure that all passers-by are happy to see. Benefits and impacts Vehicles with four or more wheels can reduce the distance between hundreds of large heavy-duty locomotives, and pedestrians with four or more wheels can reduce the traffic risks caused by large, heavy-duty locomotives that have not noticed but should pay attention to smaller volumes, thereby improving pedestrians Safety. Large heavy locomotives can leave quickly and slightly relieve the traffic jams on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue, and completely eliminate the risk of collisions caused by lane splitting. Increase the willingness of ""one-person cars"" to switch to commuting by locomotive, thereby reducing the number of cars on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue. The highway has been in operation for many years without problems, and the opening of the elevated road of Citizen Avenue and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. The efficiency of giving way to locomotives is much higher than that of automobiles. If the expressway has been in operation for many years without any problems, then the opening of the Citizen Avenue elevated road and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. If there is a faulty vehicle or a car accident, the road shoulder needs to be moved: The efficiency of locomotives merging into the lane is much higher than that of cars. If the expressway has been implemented for many years without problems, then the opening of the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue will not be a problem. In terms of benefits, the opening of the road shoulders for large and heavy locomotives is beneficial to all passers-by on the Civic Boulevard Elevated Road and Huandong Avenue. Passers-by with four or more wheels can reduce traffic jams with large and heavy locomotives and avoid the risk of front and rear collisions. Locomotives can also pass through faster to alleviate practical traffic jams. Further, passers-by with four or more wheels will be willing to use large heavy-duty locomotives to commute because of the convenience of large heavy-duty motorcycles on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue, so as to reduce the number of one-person cars on the elevated road of Civic Avenue and Huandong Avenue. In addition, the opening of large and heavy locomotives to drive on the road shoulder does not affect the original use of the road for passers-by with more than four wheels.? If other expressways are open to the shoulders of Civic Avenue Elevated Road and Huandong Avenue, large heavy locomotives will be allowed to pass. After the trial period, other expressways can be opened for use by large and heavy locomotives. To relieve traffic jams during rush hour.', ' Strive for the pilot implementation of a ban on locomotives on the inner side of the first to third sections of the two-way section of Zhongshan North Road_ ? Republic of China 77 The number of locomotives per year is 8,426,868 Taiwan, to this day 106 The annual number of locomotives has reached 21,614,728 tower. Combined with the statistics of locomotive density, the number of locomotives per 100 people, from the time of the Republic of China 77 Year 42.2 tower / Hundreds of people, to this day 91.8 tower /Hundreds of people. Under different conditions, the same law can continue to this day, I don\'t think it is possible. For the safety of the roads used by the vast number of locomotive commuters, the competent authorities must make improvements. ? First of all, there are only two-lane lanes on the outer lane of Zhongshan North Road. Motorcycle riders are forced to face the following situations every day because motorcycles are prohibited from using the inner two-lane lane : Turn left and cut right when buses of all roads stop and leave the station, taxis or Temporary loading and unloading of passengers from passenger cars, illegally parked vehicles on the roadside, illegally parked vehicles side by side on the roadside, and vehicles that merge from the inner lane to the outer lane or Outside merges into inside, etc.\xa0… Such a dangerous road environment has also led to Zhongshan North Road being the section with the highest traffic accident fatality rate in Taipei City. Similarly, the number of buses on Civic Avenue on some second-lane roads is much smaller, but the number of buses is not included in the scope of the proposal and is only for comparison purposes. ? Second, the rationality of road use. During peak hours, the outer two lanes are often crowded, while the inner road is much smoother. take me as an example :The daily commuting section is from Section 1 to Section 5 of Zhongshan North Road. There is no need to turn in the middle. It is reasonable to say that you can go straight to your destination safely on the innermost side. However, under the current harsh environment, you are forced to jam behind the bus inefficiently and be on guard at all times. Turn right and the vehicle cuts the line. This is obviously illogical, why is the straight-going vehicle blocked by the right-turning vehicle and the parking lot ?? Most of the ethnic group with weak concept of defensive driving are : Young people who have just obtained a motorcycle driver\'s license and elderly people, but the traffic policy gives them a high-risk road environment. Every time we see traffic accidents in the news, young lives are lost, and elders in the family die in car accidents. These tragedies of car accidents can indeed be reduced by modifying the evil law. ? Road users have the responsibility to abide by traffic laws, and policy makers also have the responsibility to provide road users with a safe driving environment. ? Note : The city set up ""no motorcycles"" road system in accordance with the ""Road Traffic Safety Regulations"" No. 99According to the regulations, ""prohibited motorcycles"" are arranged in the inner lanes of one-way roads with more than three lanes, and the outermost 2 The lanes are used for locomotives to reduce the mixed flow of cars and locomotives and improve traffic safety. Considering that urban roads interfere with the reasonable driving space of locomotives due to factors such as activities on adjacent streets and parking of large vehicles (buses), and taking driving safety as the highest principle, the city will continue to review and open the outer section on a case-by-case basis. 3 Locomotives are prohibited on the lane to provide a reasonable driving space for locomotives. ??', ' Traffic Improvement Proposal: Xinsheng South Road Bus Lane Moved to the Innermost Lane_ According to the original plan of the Taipei City Government, the bus lane on the Xinsheng South Road section should have been set in the innermost lane like the Songjiang Road bus lane, but it was temporarily set in the second lane on the outer side due to the construction of the MRT Xinzhuang-Luzhou Line. After the completion of the MRT, the city government originally intended to restore the original setting. However, due to the opposition of local people, the temporarily planned bus lanes have been retained until now. However, after a few years, it is not difficult for passers-by to find that there is an obvious and serious problem in this plan, that is, the innermost ( Motorcycles are prohibited, only for four-wheeled vehicles and above )The two lanes are often in an empty state, while the outermost lane separated by the bus lane is often in a congested state. The problem caused by this situation is mainly the great inconvenience for passers-by of the outer lane, including motor vehicle users and small passenger car users turning right. Motorcycle users account for a considerable part of the road users in Taipei City, and the proportion of traffic flow on this road section is no exception. According to the traffic flow survey in Taipei shown in the attached picture, in the north-south direction of Xinsheng South Road (B,D direction ) According to different road sections and time periods, the locomotive groups account for about 10% of the total traffic flow. 60%~70% Left and right, it can be said to be an absolute majority. However (1) The current bus-only lane and the design of the inner two lanes forbidding locomotives make it possible for this overwhelming majority of road users to use only the outer lane. The width of this lane can only accommodate one and a half small passenger cars. in this proportion 60%~70% The traffic volume is already quite cramped, and this lane is a mixed-flow lane, and locomotive users and passenger car users must share the space of this lane. (2)Coupled with the proximity of Jinhua Junior High School, Xinsheng Elementary School and many businesses along the line, parents pick-up, taxis, truck loading and unloading, etc. all make temporary parking and even illegal parking, which makes the space that motorcycle users can actually use very fragmented. . (3) The incoming traffic flow along the roadway pushes the capacity of this outer lane to the limit. Once a car merges in from the side, the traffic flow in this lane will have to slow down, causing the speed to lag. It can be said that the current plan is to force 60% The above road users share this road 25%The area below, and not the complete road width, is a distorted space mixed with illegally parked and right-turning cars. Passers-by who often use the outside of this section will definitely feel the congestion and inconvenience no matter the time of day. Some skeptical views may think that the small size of the motorcycle should not cause trouble. However, in such a small and distorted total area, the majority of motorcycle users have actually felt the inconvenience. It is an indisputable fact that commute times are longer and road risk increases significantly with lane conditions. There is a similar problem for the passenger car that wants to turn right at any intersection of this road segment. The passenger car that wants to turn right must meet the total traffic volume before reaching the target intersection 60%~70%The locomotives share a small space with only one lane left. A large number of illegal parking, temporary parking of taxis, and random traffic flow from the roadway all cause obvious inconvenience to the small passenger car users using this lane. Turning right after reaching the target intersection is more likely to be different from the traffic flow. There was an accident on the straight locomotive, and there was a lot of danger. Therefore, this plan is quite unfriendly to the two main user groups of Xinsheng South Road. To solve this problem, only by returning to the original traffic planning, the bus-only lane is moved to the innermost lane, and the outer space of the bus-only lane is no longer prohibited for motorcycles, so that the pedestrians on Xinsheng South Road can be returned ( Especially the majority of motorcycle users )Reasonable use of space, if the locomotives are still prohibited, the problem of insufficient allocation will not be solved for the locomotive users at all. Of course, the government should give corresponding respect to the opinions of some residents in the area who support the existing installations. However, the road planning involves not only the subjective feelings of the residents in the area, but also the objective benefits of public transportation that need to be considered. Only by taking into account the benefits and feelings of most road users into the planning can the road planning meet the actual needs. This proposal attempts to make the city government face up to the long-term inconvenience of the majority of road users through joint signatures, and show decision makers that they support the planning change. Based on the reasons stated above, we appeal to the support of all passers-by in Beishi. ??']"

The continuous price increase of cigarettes has indeed affected the rights of smokers. However, when smokers smoke while walking or riding a motorcycle, not only the majority of non-smokers are forced to inhale second-hand smoke, but also throw cigarette butts everywhere, making the environment extremely dirty. Japan is a paradise for smokers, but Japanese cigarettes are not expensive, and smoking rooms are very easy to find. Smoking is normal in Japan, and it is not something that will make others unhappy. You have to smoke yourself in the smoking area ( room ) Smoke, will not affect others. No smoking in designated smoking areas ( room )It is illegal to smoke in places other than those on the street. Smoking rooms must be set up in government public facilities, and so should private institutions, just like breastfeeding rooms are mandatory. ?', "" Plan smoking areas in public places_The number of smokers in Taiwan is still high. Smoking in public places is a major hazard to the health of non-smokers and children. It is suggested that the government should use Japan as a reference to establish good smoking planning and regulations. Planning public smoking areas can reduce the habit of smokers to smoke at any time, so as to reduce the frequency of smoking and reduce the generation of cigarette butts on the roadside. It can also reduce the problem of ditch blockage caused by cigarette butts and improve the appearance of the city. Japan's smoking ban is quite strict. Because the Japanese government is worried that when smokers walk on the road and smoke, the position where their hands hang down may burn the face or body of passing children, it is strictly forbidden to smoke while walking. In addition, the streets of Japan are also completely non-smoking outdoors, and only planned smoking areas can make people relieve their smoking cravings. For example, Japan's Shinkansen and incoming lines are completely non-smoking except for some trains, but the Shinkansen has smoking rooms every few cars, some station platforms have smoking areas, and there are also planned smoking areas next to the gates outside the stations; generally The park sets up multiple smoking areas according to the principle of proportionality according to the non-smoking area! ?"", ' Taipei City should set up smoking areas and cigarette butt recycling bins and strengthen persuasion_[The origin of the proposal] In order to reduce the phenomenon of cigarette butts all over Taiwan, we would like to take Taipei City as a model city first, and put forward the proposal that ""Taipei City should widely establish smoking areas and cigarette butt recycling bins and strengthen persuasion"". The whole proposal will be explained in detail below Through the process, we hope to get the response of the public, and work with us to improve the chaos of cigarette butts in public spaces. ? 【Proposal process】 Collect legal sources related to smoking. Draft questionnaires, collect and organize public opinion data. Obtain the majority of public opinion and propose feasible solutions. ? [Legal source basis] This proposal first consults Article 1 of the Tobacco Hazard Prevention Law 15 Smoking is completely prohibited in some places regulated by the article, such as: schools, medical institutions, government agencies, public institutions, public transportation, elevator compartments, shopping malls, and indoor workplaces shared by more than three people. No. 16The regulations for smoking areas are as follows: places where smoking areas are set up should set up obvious no-smoking signs or signs indicating no smoking except in smoking areas at all entrances and other appropriate places; and in addition to smoking areas, no smoking-related utensils. The setting of the smoking area in Paragraph 1 shall meet the following requirements: 1. The smoking area shall be clearly marked. 2. The area of the smoking area shall not be larger than half of the outdoor area of the place, and shall not be located in places that must be passed. The main crux of the problem lies in the fact that the government has not clearly regulated the setting of smoking areas in public places. It only restricts the space of smoking areas. This has little effect on the promotion of smoking areas, and there is no way to improve the negative scenery of cigarette butts in public spaces. ? [Questionnaire design and distribution] Although there are laws and regulations, the restrictive effect of cigarette butts in public spaces is still limited. Therefore, this proposal designs and distributes questionnaires by itself, and a total of 244Taiwanese celebrities of all ages submitted a questionnaire survey to understand Taiwanese people\'s views on cigarette butts, second-hand smoke, and setting up smoking barrels, ashtrays, and smoking rooms. According to the content of the self-made questionnaire, the respondents 244 Among the people, nearly 90% of the interviewees said that they have seen cigarette butts all over the ground on the road, and they said that this would hinder the beauty of the environment. Nearly 80% of the people support the government to add smoking rooms in public places, and feel that it will improve the spread of cigarette butts and the reduction of second-hand smoke. Questionnaires are 15-35 aged and 35 People over the age of 10 years and over filled it out, and the proportion of all age groups supporting the addition of smoking rooms reached 80%. It can be seen that most of the people support the addition of smoking rooms. Although it has been heard that cigarette butts can be thrown by the ditch, it has been proven that this not only pollutes the water quality, causes environmental pollution, but also causes a burden on the cleaning staff. In order to improve this situation, it is suggested that the government can strengthen the ban on cigarette butts and amend the law on littering cigarette butts (Such as: Waste Cleanup Act, Smoke Hazard Prevention Act, Environmental Protection Act, etc. ) In order to strengthen the restraint of smokers, and then promote lectures and publicity, how to reduce the phenomenon of cigarette butts all over the place . How to keep yourself from being hurt by too much second-hand smoke and so on. Based on the only 40 There are very few legal smoking rooms, but if you want to achieve a substantial effect, it is recommended to use them in convenience stores or general stores, outside your home and anywhere. Smoking buckets or garbage cans can be set up in public places for centralized recycling, and smoking rooms can be set up in some outdoor places ( Such as: botanical gardens, recreational areas, companies, exhibition areas, etc. ) , or every 200 or 300 Establish a cigarette butt recycling area based on the meter. It’s just that the construction of smoking rooms is too expensive and fragile, so it’s not easy to build. However, if the whole people can pay attention to this issue and set up recycling bins to reduce the littering of cigarette butts, I believe everyone’s neighborhood will be much cleaner!']"

Execution and current status: According to the current situation, automobiles and motorcycles at each intersection go straight or turn left and right. At the same time, the zebra crossings on the left and right sides are also open to pedestrians. This often causes vehicles turning left and right to wait in line for pedestrians to pass, resulting in traffic congestion, lane grabbing, or occupation of straight roads, etc. First, if you encounter pedestrians in Sanbao by chance, you will have safety concerns. Second, if pedestrians do not pay attention to the oncoming vehicles and force to pass, accidents will easily occur. In addition, there are many major accidents with large vehicles. Crucial point: Avoid misleading slogans such as ""Vehicles and motorcycles should give way to pedestrians"", which misleads many motor vehicle drivers or pedestrians to have the wrong idea that the zebra crossing is the biggest, or that pedestrians should know or pay attention to oncoming vehicles, etc., so it should be fully implemented Motor vehicles and pedestrians crossing the road have the right to pass separately.', ' Distinguish the time for straight vehicles, turning vehicles, and pedestrians to pass through the road.

It will cause traffic chaos. Because turning vehicles do not want to wait for pedestrians to pass through, some car owners without public morality will look for an open gear with fewer pedestrians and turn first, and some will even honk their horns to speed up pedestrians. There is a lot of resentment. Because pedestrians and vehicles are passing together, when the light is green, many motorcycles parked in the motorcycle grid on the sidewalk will pass along the pedestrian zebra crossing, increasing the danger of pedestrians. In addition, although there are many places where the time separation between vehicles and pedestrians is implemented, such as near the intersection of Xinyi District City Hall, most of these intersections are only implemented at certain times, and they will not be used at night and early morning.20 It will not be implemented after midnight, but there are still a lot of pedestrians during this period, and some traffic rushes after get off work will also appear at this time, so there will be three points of appeal.

However, if you encounter a person pushing a stroller, you often have to walk on the road when the width of the sidewalk is limited, and the bus is also advancing on a narrow lane, which is often dangerous.

The background of the proposal and the reason for the idea. Due to the needs of the course work, I have visited the rule of law for many times. I often stop at the gazebo of the rule of law park for discussion. I found that most of the members were bitten by mosquitoes more often. This also triggered our further research on the problem of mosquitoes in the park. discussion. We conducted a preliminary small experiment to investigate the number of mosquitoes in the rule of law park. We bought sticky mosquito panels and placed them in various places in the park as the experimental group, while the control group selected a small park next to the Mushan dormitory of Taipei Medical University for comparison. According to the analysis, the placement time is fixed at noon, and the test time is 40 minutes. Preliminary experiments have found that the sticky mosquito panels placed in the gazebo of the rule of law park have more mosquitoes than other places. 2. Analysis of the current situation According to our current understanding, the overall cleanliness of the rule of law park has the following factors: 1. The village chief mobilized the residents in the rule of law to help 2. Community volunteers spontaneously cleaned up 3. The environmental protection bureau of the municipal government We send people to clean it regularly. However, we still found a lot of mosquitoes and flies at the gazebo in the rule of law park. Except here, there are fewer mosquitoes in other corners of the park. We also interviewed residents who rest in the park, and some people also mentioned that they think the park has more mosquitoes. The surrounding area of this gazebo should be the fish that slipped through the net in the environmental improvement of the park. In our small experiment, the number of mosquitoes in the pools and ditches in the park is not as large as that of the gazebo. In the anti-mosquito measures we have established, the gazebo must be Enhanced focus. ※Reference source of dengue fever information: Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Health and Welfare http://www.cdc.gov.tw/diseaseinfo.aspx?treeid=8d54c504e820735b&nowtreeid=dec84a2f0c6fac5b&tid=77BFF3D4F9CB7982', ' It is suggested that more native plants should be included in the horticultural landscaping of the Dajia Riverside Park section of the Keelung River_ 1. Native flowers and flowers: a cover of aesthetics, ecology and environmental education ? ? ? In recent years, the Dajia Riverside Park section has become more and more a venue for people to rest and hold various road running activities. As a nearby resident, I often jog here, and I have also participated in local road running. Great progress has been made, but its scope is limited to the main part of the park on the left bank, and the selection of species is mostly exotic horticultural species; the part on the right bank has almost no planning, and is full of invasive exotic species such as South American Wedelia, sagegrass and copper money grass wait. ? ? ? Under the circumstances of various damages to the natural environment in Taiwan, many native plants have lost their habitats and gradually disappeared. I would like to suggest that the city government can also include some native grasses and shrubs when planning the landscape flower sea, such as Malan ( Four seasons bloom, spring can form a sea of flowers ) , Lily of Taiwan ( Unique to Taiwan, the flowers are large and showy and can adapt to various environments) , wild peony ( Strong wind resistance and good honey source ) , no bones ( Famous Butterfly Nectar Plants ) Rhododendron wulai ( Extinct in the wild urgently needs restoration, and has high ornamental value ) , Tashiro grouper ( There are many flowers, shaped like tung flowers and cherry blossoms, wind-resistant ) etc., the species suggested above all have good ornamental value, and are perennials that do not need to be replanted frequently, which can save a lot of money; moreover, they can provide habitats for creatures, and it is the best for the public to add stand-up explanations environmental education. 2. Resilient city: Embankment reinforcement plants retain water and soil ? ? ?The bellows tree, a shrub planted by the ancestors for berm protection since ancient times, was once seen everywhere in Taiwan, but it has almost become extinct in the wild in recent years due to the cementation of its waterfront habitat. Nowadays, the concept of river governance has gradually changed from cement embankment to restoration of natural embankment. Bellows tree is a very good option for native embankment reinforcement plants. On the one hand, it is easy to survive cuttings. On the other hand, it belongs to shrubs. The tree is not large and does not violate water conservancy. Flood control considerations in the ""River Area Planting Regulations"" of the Department of Agriculture will help prevent excessive erosion of river banks from causing downstream siltation. Therefore, it is recommended to the city government that it can be planted on non-cement embankments. It can be used for bank stabilization, ecology and ornamental purposes. The most important thing is to help Taiwan retain this beautiful plant.', ' It is suggested that native tree species be planted on both banks of the Dajia Riverside Park section of the Keelung River_1. Creation of original ecology, construction of characteristic waterfront Dajia Riverside Park Section has increasingly become a place for people to rest and hold various road running activities in recent years, and its scenery is overlooked from the west of Dazhi Bridge, and the surging river matches the landmark buildings Wuyuanshan Hotel and the stretching and intersecting elevated roads are really beautiful. As a nearby resident, I often jog here, and I have also participated in local road runs. I always feel that the high beach next to the river bank is too empty and overgrown with weeds. After careful investigation, I found exotic plants such as South American Wedelia, big-flowered grass and copper coins. Grasses spread and occupy the river bank, so the idea of planting native trees on the river bank was born. Selecting suitable flowering and ornamental tree species will not only attract birds and butterflies to help the development of the native ecosystem, but also its flowering season can also become a feature of Taipei’s waterfront, driving tourism development. 2. Resilient city, resilient waterfront The current concept of river water management is gradually shifting to the concept of ""multi-natural rivers"". ""The selection of trees planted in the river area mentioned above must be native tree species with ecological functions or common tree species in the river, and have deep roots, wind resistance and hydraulic characteristics. I first recommend the neem tree for the following reasons:1. There are sporadic plantings on the site, and the growth conditions are quite good after investigation, which shows that the environmental conditions must be suitable for its growth. 2. Neem is a classic native tree species, with fast growth, deep roots, and strong wind resistance. Its flowers and fruits can attract birds and butterflies. In spring, the purple flowers blooming all over the trees are quite romantic and have high ornamental value. A large number of blooms can become a tourist attraction. 3. Neem has strong vitality, can adapt to various soils, and is easy to cultivate and manage. 3. Green city, continuous belt-shaped wetland waterfront To achieve the sustainable management of rivers, coexistence with nature is absolutely the only way. I hope the city government can consider restoring the ecology of river wetlands within the allowable range, not just point-shaped wetlands The park is a stretch of strip-shaped wetland waterfront. The specific method includes planting Taiwan’s rare and native wet plants such as bellows trees, Shuishe willows, and fringed flowers in the near-water area to provide biological habitats, embankment protection, and external restoration. Conservation species. Water conservancy laws and regulations have many restrictions on planting based on flood control considerations. Therefore, it is recommended that the city government invite experts and scholars to discuss the best ecological solution under the premise of flood control.']"
