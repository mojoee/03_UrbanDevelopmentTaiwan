Even the old and weak women and children should be used regardless of age, race, and gender. Those with seats can be used. However, some people often distort the bloggers to be limited to specific ethnic groups, and even many pregnant women are deeply harmed. Regardless of other rights and interests of paying for the public. Even the average seat (non -blog seat) is not surprised! It can be seen that the same situation is common, and it is estimated that there are many black numbers that have not exploded! This proposal has strong dissatisfaction and strong condemnation of the unwilling behavior of letting the devil! \n \nAbsurd on the culture! It\'s just a copy of the pedestrian hell! Fundamental national shame! \nSitting in Bo Ai seat is basic human rights! No one has the right to deprive! \nThe government often encourages everyone to take more popular transportation tools. Even if the epidemic is currently no exception, but if the passengers\' right to ""sit"" will not be defended and the management is not good, what else do government officials have to ask everyone to take public transport instruments. \nIt is a virtue, but it is not an absolute obligation! Since it is called ""Bo Ai"", the significance of Bo Ai should be to create friendly culture, rather than unwillingness to do not friendly behavior with uncivilized thinking, and infringe the right to passengers with the needs of seats. Will the Republic of China be the country of goodness, or will we become the country of brutal first evil? How to view our Taiwan internationally! It\'s a national shame at all! \nLet the devil\'s harm to passengers equivalent to drunk driving! Zero tolerance should be implemented! \nForcing passengers who are not in good health, showing danger as other passers -by and transport passengers like passers -by and carrier! Standing forced by forced positions will affect a sense of balance and cause serious consequences for being standing for a long time! The proliferation of the devil is rampant, which is worrying about the safety of mass transportation tools! However, the behavior of some false justice and true evil devil has made everyone\'s commuting more indexed in fear. It is strongly required to have a strong requirement to compare the standards of severe punishment and tolerance. The current situation of a series of forced seats and even physical attacks calls on relevant government units to amend the law as soon as possible, in the ""Public MRT Law"", ""Railway Law"", and ""Regulations on the Management Rules of Automobile Transportation Industry or Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations"" The penalties are formulated, and anyone is strictly forbidden to have any disturbing behavior of anyone who needs seats in the MRT, the Taiwan Railway and the high -speed rail, and the bus, and forced the seat of the seat for the use of words or physical behavior, as well as occupying others, and occupying others. Volkswagen transportation will be punished on the behavior of the number of seats, and appropriately limit the qualifications of the use of the use of Volkswagen\'s transportation depends on the situation to curb the devil. \nThe penalty is as follows:\nFor passengers such as ""priority seats (Boai seats)"" and old -fashioned old women and children, inconvenient mobility, injuries, physical discomfort, pregnant women, infants and children, and actual needs, such as "" Those who disturb, discrimination, and obstruct the ride of the limbs and other forms will be fined 15,000 to 75,000, and will be limited to the qualifications of any ride discount (student ticket, respect/love ticket, 1280 regular ticket) for six months to one year. \nThose who occupy the seats and one of the two seats or one person occupy or occupy the counterparts to cause others to be unable to ride, and be fined 3,000 to 15,000; \nThose who disturb or discriminate in other forms or discriminate in other forms shall be fined 75,000 and prohibit the use of any preferential qualifications for one year; those who involve criminal crimes involving forced and harmful imprisonment. \nThose who have committed more than two (inclusive) within one year shall be fined 75,000 and prohibit any preferential qualifications for one year. \nIf the other party\'s casualties (including trauma, cause abortion, bleeding, or fetal unstable injury, patients to aggravate physiological adverse reactions, etc.), they will be sentenced to more than one year or seven years, and will permanently prohibit any preferential qualifications. Those who are seriously injured or dead are imprisoned for seven years. \nFor example, the transportation of the public outside the MRT, railway, and high -speed rail, such as bus, etc. There are listed situations, personnel of driving or transportation places shall notify law enforcement agencies for processing.

In the Police Department and its management at all levels, in addition to the commutation system, there are countless external diligence personnel. The characteristics of 24 -hour rotation are not available for physiological and psychological loss. Cumulative into various symptoms and even cancer, the required medical resources and subsidies are likely to overwhelm the family economy. Different rewards at the same level are the facts of the receptor. Fixed commuting system can also maintain a ""normal"" social life, and plans to use national travel cards, family relationships, etc. These are the ""rights"" lacking of external diligence. When they sacrifice these normal life models and sacrifice their mental health, they only maintain the normalization of ""public security"" and ""traffic"" for the public because of their duty mission. The group insurance cannot provide complete guarantee. May I ask: Isn\'t there any problem with the long -term physiological schedule, will the five internal organs? If it causes severe illnesses, it is unreasonable to take care of themselves. Foreign diligently need to have a more complete guarantee, and the overtime work must face unpredictable risks. The time salary that is converted is less than private preservation. Compared with the personnel of the up and down system, it is very different. Every foreign service unit in Taiwan is missing, and the same levels are different. They have to sacrifice health. This should not be the norm, and it should not be left for the gap for the next generation. \n2. Health in the heart has become a common problem in society. Most people have the demonization of diseases, or they have caused fear due to ignorance, rejection due to fear, and discrimination or self -harm due to exclusion. Physiological health affects mental health, and the fatigue of mental health cannot be underestimated. The standards of international general cases, groups, organizations, governments, enterprises, etc., should set up necessary emergency response measures. If consulting medical behavior is involved, it will provide relevant consulting medical treatment with third parties. However, although the Police Department has the establishment of Guan Guan, even if he claims that he will not be involved in the consultation business, the actual operation method is to be unsuitable for players and referees. Before the presence of those proposed by those who were previously proposed, municipalities directly under the Central Government were undertaken by various units for ""psychological counseling"" professional expertise, such as: branch inspection, defense, civil defense, secretary, etc. The business unit is uniformly submitted to the secretary\'s office to ""co -organizes"". If the police do have a consulting needs, they must inform the training section of the ""Secretary\'s Office"", and then arrange the ""Teacher Guan"" business personnel in the training department to intervene in care. "" ""Medical"" is also human rights. Why do you advocate basic human rights? What\'s more, if police officers have mental symptoms, they often come from the bad habits of the existing system. \n3. The current setting of the teacher cannot also prevent the SOS incident. As described earlier, most people have the demonization of diseases, and without privacy medical human rights, who dares to seek assistance under the Police Department? The requirements of the long -term different outdated, illegal, and illegal officials require that the upper and lower personnel who violate the command of the Executive Yuan to conduct business confidential transmission through commercial software LINE, and they must keep the line of LINE at all times. It seriously affects the physiological and mental health of the police. It is said that if you wear it, you have to keep your original intention and be willing to pay to the society and the country.

At the stage of high school, the self -consciousness is becoming more and more obvious. Through the socialization of the Internet or work, it makes them more manifested. In addition, the current loose education system and high school rate (university are very easy to obtain), all of which cause students to educate high school education in high school education. The low -responsibility mentality is formed. The tuition fees for compulsory education at high school are low, so they do not come to school, the credits are two 1, parents and students may not be painful or itchy; enter the university door learning low, the same academic ability can easily hold college students, so you can not get the graduation certificate. It doesn't matter. In this way, do college students in Taiwan really hope that the academic ability that college students should have internationally? Is the taxpayer paid by the taxpayer is worthy of education? Many government policies are too welfare. The type of welfare, thinking that taking care of the people will ignore the education of the people and in the long run, it will damage the human quality and cause adverse impact on national strength. \nNational strength is not only important in military and economy, but also very important for human quality. Although the intention of compulsory education is good, the final juncture is not strictly controlled, which will lead to students and even parents who are afraid of compulsory education. Students do not come to class. As long as they get four semester transcripts, they can be the same academic ability. Students cannot obtain a graduation certificate. There are also universities to admit to survival. College students will only have more and more high school graduation certificates, and even in fact there is only a pseudo -students of the junior high school. Therefore, the current appraisal test of the same academic ability should not be limited to self -study, but should be expanded to all student status and hang in school. In the end, those who cannot get a graduation certificate will prove that they can be proved to have a certain degree of academic ability to enter university. Even if the university cannot interfere with autonomy, so as not to seriously reduce the entrance examination in order to survive. Another proposal to repay the tuition fee is to improve the way of students, and they can also urge parents to take the responsibility of education. In the case of no government affording compulsory education, how much tuition should I pay? , Repair the tuition fees according to the score of the lack of scores."", ""Taiwan Education International Progress Progress Plan_1 Taiwan education should be educated with the strengths of students. \n(1) Selecting courses should be selected with students' strengths\n(2) Other subjects should learn and understand basically\n(3) Use the curriculum academic system to allow students to arrange lessons themselves\n(4) Do not use age as a student standard (for example, to take a course in a nearby university, you can also take the simple courses.\n(5) The total classes of a single semester should not exceed 6 kinds of students to read too many subjects at a time｝\n2 The teaching attitude and model of Taiwanese school teachers should be improved.

Proposal motivation\n\xa0 \nBecause many students often reflect the inadequate teaching of teachers at the teaching site of high school today, or some teachers often have disrespect for students\' teaching, personality rights, or violating gender equality or even violating the provisions of the Teacher Law. Improper words and deeds; and at the high school stage, teachers have the students\' grades and credits, and the school has the right to speak; \n\xa0 \nAlthough the Judge\'s interpretation has broken the special power relationship between the students and the school, under the influence of the previous social atmosphere and the educational environment, students will still be afraid of the teachers as ""teachers"" when facing what they mentioned above. This identity is often unable to be heard by the school\'s opinions. \n\xa0 \nTherefore, I think that in the advanced and secondary education stage (high school, higher vocational, five colleges, three years, etc.), the teacher teaching evaluation system mentioned in the ""University Law"" §21 (*) should be introduced. The results of the lesson are sent to the competent education authority for review, and the evaluation results can also be listed as one of the projects for regular school evaluations of the Ministry of Education. \n\xa0 \nAnd this can also be designed on the questionnaire, and can also cultivate students\' ability to think, criticize and express independently, and the ability mentioned above. The above -mentioned ability is also a part of literacy education emphasized by the 108th syllabus. \n\xa0 \nHow to implement the plan\n\xa0 \nEach high school can refer to the teaching evaluation content of various universities, and then modify the content of the evaluation questionnaire content according to the differences in the nature of high school and university education. In the questionnaire response, the school found that the teacher\'s illegal or unsuitable or infringing the right to the students\' teaching rights should immediately notify the corresponding punishment with the competent authority and the severity of the plot; Notify students or provide them with opinions as a teaching method. \n\xa0 \nAt the same time, the Ministry of Education can also set up relevant rules or methods to make this idea, so that the situation of the teaching site is more balanced, and students can receive education in a good education environment. \n\xa0 \nIn addition, this questionnaire shall take the academic affairs office of each school as a supervisor, and at the same time, the school is prohibited from publishing, leaking, and implying students \'names or scholarship numbers to identify students\' identity information. \n\xa0 \nIn addition, the evaluation survey can be selected as the main topic, and the title is supplemented. This can take the school to truly understand the students\' ideas and related reasons. \n\xa0 \n*: ""University Law"" Article 21\n1. The university shall establish a teacher evaluation system to evaluate the effectiveness of teachers \'teaching, research, counseling and service results. As an important reference for teachers\' promotion, renewal, long -term appointment, suspension, non -continuity, and rewards. \n2.

But I can\'t help it, because they are straight. I can only turn around when turning the red light! However, this is actually very risky, and it is likely to be hit by a car with a yellow lamp over the rear. Because the return journey goes first, it passes through the same intersection. When the red light, I turned left to the left. When I turned the green light, I asked him first, but he hesitated again. As a result, I was pressed by the rear car again. It really is not, not letting it is not ... because this intersection usually has very few cars, but there are many cars during the peak period, and they often block them. However, because the road width was insufficient, even the sidewalks were gone, and the intermediate lane could not be extended. It was very difficult to expand land. However, it is usually only available at the narrow intersection. If you encounter a left -turning car for a long time, you will block the whole row. So when I just turned the lights, I would let the other person turn left to the left, but if I am not in the first one, I can\'t help it. And not everyone will be willing to give up. At this time, you must wait until you turn left and right to turn! Otherwise, wait until the green light time passes, and see if there is a chance to turn successfully in the next round! Even if it is changed to a red light (or when turning a green light), the left -turn time is forced to add a period of left, which only improves to a part (waiting for the first left car). Wait until the next round, it will be blocked to the rear car. But at least you don\'t have to wait until the third round! \nRelated regulations: 1. Article 102, paragraph 2, paragraph 2, paragraph 2 of traffic safety rules stipulates that: If you go to the fork in the fork of the non -number or number of the number without traffic commanders, the side car should be suspended to allow the trunk lane car to do it first. Those who have no signs, labeling lines or aspirations, and branches, and the large -line roads should be suspended to allow the multi -line trails to advance; when the number of lanes is the same, the turning car should be paused for direct bikes first; The left car should be paused to let the right car go first. However, when traffic jams, the two -way vehicles should be suspended before stopping the line. 2. Article 102, paragraph 1, paragraph 7 of traffic safety rules stipulates: Turning vehicles shall allow direct buses to do it first. 3. Article 102, paragraph 1, paragraph 8 of traffic safety rules stipulates that when the two cars are connected to the same intersection, the left car is preferred. (Whether it is an unpopular intersection?) Sort the priority (also applicable to the number intersection) 1. Special number (arrow) priority 2. General number (circular) first. 3. The trunk road is preferred (flashing red, yellow light), and the branch line must wait until there is no car in the trunk. 4. Great Road Preference (Non -Number) 5. Straight bicycle priority (time of no number) 6. Priority on the right side (number of the same lanes) 7. Left transfer priority (transfer to the same intersection on the car, including the number of Zhizhi intersections) 8. During the stuff, the rules and conditions such as the interaction pass through (when there is no number) is too complicated and too many, but the book is also counted. Essence Among them, because of the priority of the trunk line, the trunk turning vehicle will be preferred than the branches straight, but it will not be divided into a direct car and it will be preferred. This rules adapt to local conditions are a bad design! It seems that the left car is blocked because of the 5th point. In fact, the main problem is whether the plug at point 8 is completely dependent on the same as the same, and almost no one will follow. What is the extent? Although the whole row of the car is blocked, the traffic flow is smooth! And the premise of this clause is the intersection of the nobles and no command. \nImprovement plan: 1. Simplify rules: The trunk and branch lines are clearly divided in advance by marking (it is recommended to distinguish between short dotted lines). There is no need to look at it, no size, and you know who is priority at a glance. In this way, it can save the 4th, 5th, and 6th in the rules of the preceding paragraph, which also resolves the contradictions. In particular, the non -number intersection cannot have equal rights. 2. Adjust the priority order: 1. Special number (arrow) preferred 2. General number (circular) preferred 3. The trunk priority (when there is no number). Essence 4. In the case of conflict*, you must pass through the interaction (only the opposite vehicle, including the general number of the intersection), but if you cannot distinguish who arrives first, you can directly drive (follow the old rules) or the right transfer ** start first. ***, that is, straight-> left-> straight ... or right turn-> left-> straight ... straight ... go straight ...\n* The definition of ""conflict"" is clear, which is easier to determine than ""congestion"" and there is no vague zone. In this way, no matter whether there are nanoons, the laws of interactive interaction are forced. ** It is also possible to use the left turn priority, but the right to the right will be higher. *** ""Starting first"" means that it is only temporarily preferred to solve the deadlock that occurs temporary. \n3. The order of priority should be clearly written into the traffic rules, and the original Article 102, paragraph 1, paragraph 2, 7, and 8 shall be integrated into the above rules and abolish. 4. Under the conditions permitted by the road width, the intersection should be completely changed to the central left -turn special lane+dedicated number records, so that the direct train and the left -to -vehicle time areolate. 5. The intersection of multi -lane and no nag also should be changed to prohibit the left turn to avoid the sudden left -turn cars to interfere with the straight car. 6. Pedestrian traversal (zebra crossing) should shrink a distance above the body, surrounded by railings at the intersection. In this way, turning cars will not affect the traffic traffic because of waiting for pedestrians. 7. Eliminate deformity intersection: The deformity intersection has always been a hot spot in a car accident. It is impossible to improve the circular, one -way lanes, left -turn, and special number of regulatory control when the lane is eliminated. 8. Cancel the flashy yellow and red light period that is changed due to the time period. The flashing period is often the accident period.', 'The rights and interests of Taiwan locomotives_Proposal motivation:\nAt present, the planning of roads in Taiwan is not very friendly to the locomotive knight. For example, the special lanes for locomotives are very inconsistent in different places, so that the locomotive people sometimes need to follow, and sometimes they must squeeze the same road as the four -wheel car. , Especially during the peak traffic period, the locomotive knights who often charter cars are more likely to be dangerous, but only they need two sections of left turn, often making people suffer that they cannot get the rights they deserve; there are still many cars in Taiwan in Taiwan. The ""horizontal domineering"" on the road may be relying on the gap between the car body and let the rules of the straight trucks turn around regardless of the ritual, or because of the dead corner of the four -wheeled body, etc., it often causes a car accident; I think the locomotive The dedicated track is set on the right of the road, but it is necessary to prevent those cars that turn right, and sometimes even cause the locomotive lane to turn the car due to too much blockage. \nRecommended content:\n1. Rewarding and improvement of locomotive lanes need to be divided clearly with the car lane\n2. Increase related road specifications\n3. Extracted a penalty of unwilling car\n4.

At present\nAnd unless parking is parking, the fast lane should be driven (if the road on the right is a road that prohibits parking on the red line, the slow lane cannot drive the auto locomotive) (to let the traffic lights of the traffic lights be separated from the green light of the bicycle, so that it will not The collision is the turning green light+bicycle green light+pedestrian green light at the same time. The next time it is the right turning green light of the motor vehicle. At this time, the bicycles and pedestrians are red lights).

In the future, ""extremely slow"" to change the smart meter (who wants to make new technologies also involve)\n \n \n In fact, it is not to say how bad before, but new thinking and concepts are also generations of generations and generations.\n After personal limited knowledge assessment, I still feel that I should start with the concept of ""consumer psychology"". Vernacular is to buy electricity to use pulling. Electricity is not credit. Isn\'t it strange to execute? Does it mean the source of environmental pollution?\n At this time, calm down and change to the future. If we look at the appropriate power plant every month today, if the animal husbandry provides human food, if the discharged waste is used as a biogas to power the power, named the pig power plant, or the enterprise, or the enterprise Power lack of electricity to generate electricity nearby. In fact, what I want to say is that the previous generation of society has limited the concept of power generation. The circular power and the circular economy are indispensable together. Instead of earth, but people have to live on the earth, logic needs to be correct, so that there will be no contradictions and conflicts. Of course, the process is a difficult process.\n \n \n Although there are flaws in electricity in various countries, the technology that awaken people\'s power -saving power is the activity that the modern government will drive, and it is no longer a policy. If everyone is full of 3 lights in 3 rooms in the evening, there are only one person. Don\'t you feel vomiting to build a power plant for wasting electricity? \n There is no perfect solution in the world at present. Perhaps Taiwan is going to go out of its own way. Thanks to Tang Feng\'s digital government again, let the people have a platform for thinking policies.', ""Nuclear energy and green energy power generation electricity price grading system_Today, Taiwan's power generation methods include nuclear energy, coal, gas, green energy, hydraulic, wind power, etc. every year, the power supply is tight every year, and due to the high awareness of environmental protection, people's livelihood power, industrial electricity, environmental protection, environmental protection, environmental protection, environmental protection It is impossible to obtain a relatively balanced balance. Therefore, it is recommended that the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Economic Affairs cooperated with Taipower to conduct a census of the meter. Sustainable operation of Taiwan or those who have only one of our environmental protection awareness of the earth, then use the electricity price of green energy, and according to the choice method and the population structure charges and development corresponding power. And the population structure intermittent power outage.

Payment of use: not according to age, pay health insurance premiums according to the use of health insurance conditions and times. 2. Disputes of the health insurance premiums detained in the detention center are controversial by the entire people: all criminals and criminals who are detained in the detention center must work in prisons or use social work to pay health insurance premiums. 3. The Health Insurance Department uses virtual income to charge the same health insurance premiums from people who do not work income. They lied that they all had unemployment subsidies and low -income households subsidies: people who did not work in Taiwan and low -income households relative to everyone in Taiwan. Less health insurance premiums, but the same is compared with the proportion of use: not according to the age, the health insurance premium is paid according to the health insurance status and the number of times. 4. Health Insurance Mouse: According to the statistics of the Taiwan media quoting the Health Insurance Agency, 57,000 people returned to Taiwan in 2015 and surrendered in the middle of the medical treatment. These people were also called Health Insurance Mouse by the media. Health insurance mice must pay the health insurance costs that have been owed before the stage, otherwise the punishment must be permanently not allowed to be healthy. 5. Internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and other college doctors have high risk and heavy burden, but the payment of national health insurance obviously does not reflect the risks and burdens of these specialists, making it difficult for these four subjects to recruit sufficient blood and talents.

Pharmaceutical price black hole: If a disease is completed, pay at a price; or pay for people, then the medical institution will consider the final economic benefits, and the medicine will be contained in a large payment unit (yes, yes, yes, so On diseases or people), the black hole in the drug price is naturally meaningless. However, this system also has disadvantages. Due to the difficulty of treatment of the same disease, many preceding examples show that the hospital will want to refuse patients who are more difficult to treat (such as elderly people and complicated diseases, although this system will give these diseases to these diseases to these diseases. The patients are more high -paying), and the hospital is discharged early because of the patient\'s payment. The hospital was discharged early due to the full use of patients ... 7. Medical staff should avoid overtime work. However, some senior doctors still have the concept of ""long -term labor is a necessary training for qualified doctors."" For compulsory legislation stipulate the working hours length of medical staff, set up medical disadvantages and set up a reward and punishment system, and provide the entire Taiwan medical staff and patients with medical treatment. Consultation numbers and performance issues: The big hospital will desperately see the doctor\'s real needs regardless of the real needs of the patient. The legislation stipulates that the relevant penalties are also set up, and the medical disadvantages are also established and the reward and punishment system is set to provide a pipeline for reporting from Taiwan\'s medical staff and patients with medical treatment. 8. Doctors\' elimination system: For medical disputes, there are also medical disadvantages to report websites and set up a reward and punishment system to provide medical staff and medical patients in Taiwan.

According to a news media electronics, ""The"" Zuo Ying Case ""of the high -speed rail extension of Pingtung is unreasonable? The content of the Railway Administration\'s information proposes the content of the three weaknesses pointed out that in 108 (2019) the Republic of China, the ""Zuoying Branch Line Program"" led by Cabinet\'s tendency to support the cabinet is due to cost, land acquisition and construction schedule supported by the cabinet. The advantage has achieved a victory and approved the feasibility study report on December 10, 109. The time of the Republic of China was from July to August 110. It was shocking that it was expected that the orbits of the high track of Renwu District through Renwu, Bird Song, and Dashu\'s Zuoying branch scheme will pass petrochemistry The factory area is opposed by many environmental impact assessment professionals and local residents, and has to be changed to a parallel route plan with the high -screen second fast road. Although this solution avoids the petrochemical plant area, according to the content of the news report, the left camp will cause the following three weaknesses. \n1. First of all, the high -speed railway electric vehicle will have a ""backward"" back to the north to drive north to drive to the six -block farm of Pingtung City Pingtung County. In other words, the High -speed Railway Zuoying case can only use the first lane of the first platform. This move must not only let the high -speed rail driver walk from the cabin\'s front of the train to the cale of the 12th carriage, but also make passengers rotating their seats at the Zuoying Station. 2. Followed by high -speed rail capacity limited. According to the existing space of the Zuoying Base, once the construction plan of the Zuoying branch line is implemented, only two flights to the left camp to Pingtung can only be opened per hour, which cannot meet the needs of the people in Pingtung County and the subsequent extension planning. 3. The orbital configuration of the Zuoying branch scheme repeatedly will seriously affect the functions of the Zuoying vehicle base, and will also affect the existing sign and operation system. The orbit of the inlet and maintenance base is equipped with a conversion track, derail and derailment space in accordance with the existing regulations; but the conditions of the present stage do not meet the above needs. \nI think it is strongly recommended to extend Pingtung on high -speed rail. Pingtung must definitely adopt the Kaohsiung Railway Station solution that can make the train safely. As for Pingtung, there are many Pingtung County Pingtung High -speed Railway Station that should not be set up on Pingtung\'s six -piece farm in Pingtung City. stand. In any case, I think: the high -speed rail extending Pingtung must definitely give priority to the construction of the high -speed rail Zuoying Station (Taiwan Railway Xinzuying Station) to the Taiwan Railway Kaohsiung Station in the shortest time. Open. As for the section of extended Pingtung, please submit to the Ministry of Communications to deliver to the people of Pingtung County for one year. The above seven may have one of the above -mentioned stations at the railway station, Donggang, or Puyu Station. In addition, many Kaohsiung citizens also hope to set up high -speed rail stations at Xiaogang International Airport. They also ask the Ministry of Communications Railway Bureau to build the high -speed rail support line corridor and citations that reserve the high -speed rail support line to Xiaogang Airport through Kaohsiung Railway Station.', 'The high -speed rail extension of the ""Zuoying Plan"" was changed to the ""Kaohsiung Plan"" and evaluated whether it was extended from Pingbei to Taitung!_There are currently many people who are opposed by the ""Zuoying Branch Line Program""!

Unfortunately, under the current election system, waste tickets are invalid votes. In addition to symbolizing the dissatisfaction of some voters, there is no ability to affect the election results. In 2018, the election of Maiyu Township, Yunlin County, was an example. The former head of the township who was re -elected announced the withdrawal on the last day of the registration. The candidate only needs to be elected as the same number of campaign with a total number of human rights. This was considered a private granting and caused a rebound in the villagers. They organized a waste ticket alliance to call for everyone to vote for votes to resist this unfair election. As a result, the candidate won the threshold of 8068 votes at low altitude, but the waste votes were as high as nearly twice as high as twice, setting a new high in the proportion of scrap votes in the history of our elections!

However, after the self -constitutional constitution, the legislature has never reviewed whether its content is in line with the principle of equality of the Constitution. The so -called ""Different Social Life Functional Restaurant of Men and women and the differences between the differences between the differences between the difference between the difference between the men and the girls and the difference in the difference between the difference between the difference between the legislators?"" It is for the purpose of practicing the country\'s purpose and the basic obligations of the ""Constitution"". ""However, there was no constitution in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The so -called ""physiological differences between men and women and the differences in social life function that are different from this difference"" in this explanation strongly implies that ""men should have masculinity and women should have a feminine temperament."" The promotion of serious damage to gender equality can even be said to be discriminatory. Even if the legislative era has its own consideration, the government should now determine whether the law is reasonable based on the ""different role of social life function"", rather than the explanation text as a amulet. In recent years, many gender and equal movements have been carried out one after another. ""Different social life functions"" can no longer be used as rough division of ""men and women"". The recent response of the Ministry of National Defense has made the above many fallacy in response. Even though the Ministry of the Interior reminds ""the principle of reasoning whether the legislative purpose of the military service law is reasonable and differentiated to review the principle of equal equality"", it still does not carefully compare the application of the ""Interim Special Measures"" regulated by the United Nations ""eliminating the discrimination of all forms of women"". It has never considered tailoring this method into ""temporary special measures"". It is difficult for this system to stop adopting it as stated in Article 4 of the Convention ""after the purpose of men and women and equality for treatment."" What\'s more, the military service system actually caused the phenomenon of ""the standards that cause inequality or separate standards"" prohibited by the Convention. If this system cannot be understood as ""discount differences"", it will inevitably strengthen the gender discrimination mentioned above. Therefore, even if you want to maintain this system, the law should still be amended to make it a ""temporary special measure."" The Ministry of National Defense thought that the national military service system was ""clearly determined by the laws of most countries."" However, most countries do not enforce national military service or receive military training in practice. In 2003, the European court ruled that German men\'s recruitment violated the EU\'s waiting instructions. The United States currently only retains the recruitment in law. In June 2016, the Senate incorporated women into the recruitment bill; in 2013, Norway passed the Female Principles Act and was implemented in 2016. Sweden will also restore gender recruitment in 2018. Although the above countries are not in the majority, they may not be available for our reference. The Ministry of National Defense believes that after the implementation of the transformation of the recruitment system, women can ""allow women to meet the service standards and are interested in military professional work to join the ranks of the National Army."" However, the current situation of the Military Service Law is not the appearance of the transformation of the recruitment system. If the government really wants to implement the transformation of the recruitment system, it is bound to abolish the men\'s forced men to serve military service and military training in the ""Military Service Law"". In order to ""allow men to meet the service standards and are interested in military professional work, men can join the ranks of the national army."" It is necessary to the amendments to the ""Military Service Law"". In order to recruit soldiers or do not recruit at all, they can promote flatness.', 'In 2019, cross -strait relations are tight and advocated that the military and women\'s military service military training for military and women\'s service is advocated to make up for the sources of inadequate troops._Article 1 of the ""Military Service Law"" stipulates: ""The men of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve military service according to law."" Obviously, Article 7 of the Constitution is touched: ""The people of the Republic of China have no divisions of men and women, religion, race, class, and party. ""Previous"" and Article 10, Article 10 of the Constitutional Repair Article 8: ""The state should maintain the dignity of women\'s personality, ensure the personal safety of women, eliminate gender discrimination, and promote the essence of the two sex."" The principle of equality. This topic was mentioned 3 years ago, and now that it is changed to a full -scale fundraising system, I hope that the government can make adjustments to this proposal again. \nAt present, the national defense has been changed to a comprehensive recruitment system in 2018, but men of the Republic of China still have to take 4 months of military training. Compared with female citizens, this has not fully implemented social fairness and justice. Men are still deprived of a small period of time to do their best to do their best. Today, society has become open, and women are gradually emerging in various fields. Therefore, women should have the ability to serve military service and need to work with men with their obligations. In the previous ""Modification of the"" Military Service Law "", gender inequality. The obligation of national service is not different due to physiological gender. The ""Great Justice Meeting mentioned in this proposal will position the principle of equality in the"" legal status and equal equality "". Today, women\'s ability is basically not much different from men, and"" physiological differences in men and women ""have been by the outside world. It is deemed to use relevant measures to make up. For example, the whole people of Israel have been doing for the years, women are not relatively weak in service in military service, and they can distribute the corresponding positions according to their gender, and in terms of physical fitness, regardless of their physical fitness Both men and women can make up for the gap between the two through the acquired training; foreign female athletes have dazzling results in today\'s international sports events. While female athletes participate in training, they should accompany physiological problems, but women Athletes can overcome and receive corresponding training and participate in the event, so the physiological gap may not be able to become a reason why women cannot accept military training. ""After the implementation of the transformation of the recruitment system in our country, China\'s military service has gradually expanded the human manpower of the society, so that women who meet the service standards and are interested in military professional work can join the ranks of the national army and review the amount of employee and service system year by year to ensure gender equality. ""The right to work."" At present, the recruitment system is promoted for one year. Relevant units know that the effect of recruitment does not meet the expectations. Ability and obligation to do their best to do national defense. \nIn the case of increasingly tight cross -strait relations today, it is not a policy to consider incorporating female citizens into the scope of military training for 4 months. After implementation, it can implement the true fairness and justice of society and achieve the long -term equality of the society. Men and women are all nationals of the Republic of China. They have different obligations that are no longer the same in the current society in the Constitution in today\'s society. Traditional society believes that women have children, and the concept of male protection of men is that the status of women\'s social status has not been improved. In the years, women\'s talents are abound in today\'s society. Born children are no longer the only life options for women; and fertility is not necessary in the current social concept. Women can choose whether to get pregnant and have children, and have children in a suitable time. And under the premise that men will still raise their obligations, men\'s military service does not have the right to choose under the current law. Therefore, in the case of emphasizing ""social equality"", women\'s military service is a necessary reform and can meet social fairness at the same time. The issue of justice and making up for the lack of troops, the burden of protecting the country and the country is no longer just the obligation of male citizens. It is hoped that the government can encourage men and women to work together to make society more harmonious.', 'Modify the entry of gender inequality in the ""Military Service Law"". The obligation of national service is not different due to physiological gender._Article 1 of the ""Military Service Law"" stipulates: ""The men of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve military service according to law."" Obviously, Article 7 of the Constitution is touched: ""The people of the Republic of China have no divisions of men and women, religion, race, class, and party. ""Previous"" and Article 10, Article 10 of the Constitutional Repair Article 8: ""The state should maintain the dignity of women\'s personality, ensure the personal safety of women, eliminate gender discrimination, and promote the essence of the two sex."" The principle of equality. Although the Zi Zi No. 490 has explained that the law is not unconstitutional with the ""different physiological differences between men and women and the role of social life function that has been different from this difference"". However, not the physique of all women is not suitable for service standards. The proportion principle set by the law shall determine whether individual citizens can be exempted in accordance with the physical fitness of individual citizens. The so -called ""different role role of social life"" will be regarded as a reason to deprive the right to work in the workplace. The current military service system is to allow some people to be deprived of their lives for several months to years, only because of gender reasons. At the same time, other people of the same age can enjoy more freedom and enter society early, and accumulate life capital. Increasing the obligations of some citizens, and unloading the obligations of some citizens. This is legal in law. The Constitution stipulates that the obligation to serve military service is based on the needs of national defense, and ""national defense"" should not be ""men\'s defense."" Even if the demand for modern defense may be changed to the recruitment system. However, before fully practicing the recruitment system, if there is still a need for national defense to participate in national defense, nationals other than men should be included in the recruitment. It should not be legally distinguished by gender. Now the military service law stipulates that only boys must serve military service (voluntary service), and girls have no military service and volunteer service. I think the provisions of the military service law are an unfair treatment for girls. It is necessary to have the obligation to serve the military service of the whole people, rather than the ""men\'s obligation"" that can only be targeted at boys. There will be no unequal provisions to implement a flat society.']"

They should force Taiwan to perform TNVR of external stray cats and dogs, reduce the hyperplasia of external stray cats and dogs, and incorporate TNVR into policies and laws. Cats are all pet registration, which can force local governments to manage stray dogs and cats, control ethnic groups, and accelerate TNVR sterilization. \n2.

The public animal receiving institutes from Taiwan have banned dogs and cats. Although it is regarded as a major progress of the Taiwan Animal Conservation Movement, the passage of such a policy lacks response to supporting measures, and may even bring greater damage and impact on animals. Because zero security dies, the people have become more at ease, and no longer worry about whether this will be condemned, so there will be more stray animals than ever. Therefore, in order to relieve the animal density of the shelter, the local government transferred the principle of ""precise capture"", that is, unless the stray dog \u200b\u200bhas an attack or harm, and obtained the confirmation of the reporter, it can be captured, but this is equivalent to making stray dogs Continue to wandering on the street also makes frontline personnel often face the people\'s protest calls. \n Wandering animals are overly reproduced, coupled with the excessive container of animal shelters, excessive accumulation of stray animals, the environment is messy, and the animals are uncomfortable, but it is easy to cause the disease and infection of the disease. \n \nProposal content\n \n  After adopting stray animals to the public container, it is marked as a stray animal in the chip of the pet.  \n  Pets with stray animals, after confirmation, can be ligated for free until the animal hospital and have a free animal health check.  \n  Any animal adopted at will, will be checked according to the chip and a penalty will be punished by the pet owner.', 'Promote the illegal feeding of stray animals and set up feeding areas and other supporting measures_Proposal:\nThe division area is divided into a unit, and a feeding stray dog \u200b\u200barea is set up in each one. It is stipulated that in the future, as long as it is feeding a stray dog, it can only be fed in the area and legislates people who feed the stray dogs outside the area. In addition, the dogs who accept feeding must be ligated. The establishment of the stray dog \u200b\u200barea is established, that is, in addition to the private area, only the stray dog \u200b\u200bcan be fed in the area, and in addition to the government leading, the general public can also feed stray dogs in the area. There is only one main purpose of feeding areas: so that stray dogs in this area can only find food in the feeding area, and then make them gather in feeding areas or near the area. Among them, the role of the government is to provide dog food and manage the region with only stray dogs, and whether the stray dogs that have always paid attention to and distinguish the area have been ligated. In this part, we believe that the government can cooperate with civilian related animal protection organizations or groups. In addition, the stray dogs that have now lived in the legal person\'s institution can be adopted and manage by the legal person to ensure that its chip and ligation have been cast. If the legal person refuses to adopt, it shall be regarded as a stray dog. \nThe punishment of illegal law is included in the Dynamic Insurance Law, mainly to ban the current criminals and slowly open penalties. Feed stray dogs outside the feeding area. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the ones to discard the garbage at will, and strengthen the cleaning of the streets to prevent stray dogs from looking at and biting garbage at will, especially the tourist area and restaurant gathering. \nIn addition, if we set up feeding outside the feeding area, only the feeders can prove that their feeding dogs are owned by themselves or their relatives and friends, and they can not be punished. Without ligation, you can persuade the pet dog to ligate. If you repeatedly persuaded you, you can impose a penalty of NT $ 50,000 to RMB 250,000 according to Article 27, Paragraph 1) of the Animal Protection Law. This setting is also to increase the family dogs that can go out to be able to use chips and ensure ligation, and reduce the number of dogs that are raw randomly, because if they are fed outside the feeding area, they are also within the scope of penalties. \nAmong them, the measures we formulated on the ligation part of the stray dog \u200b\u200bis to use whether the ear cutting as the identification foundation, and the non -ligated stray dog \u200b\u200bin the feeding area must be separated. TNVR is performed within 7 days. In addition, the ligated stray dog \u200b\u200bmust be paired with ear cutting to facilitate subsequent recognition. \nFinally, the purpose of this solution is once again: forcing stray dogs to gather in the area that can feed the stray dog \u200b\u200barea, and to identify the unsuccessful stray dogs for section to reduce the number of existing stray dogs and increase the ligation rate, reduce the number of reproduction quantities Essence \nReasons for pushing the scheme:\nAccording to the survey of the Agricultural Committee, after the 2017 ""zero -culprit"" policy began to be on the road, most of the shelters reducing the amount of dogs and cats, which led to the increase in the number of swing dogs year by year. According to the estimation results of the number of national wandering dogs from the Agricultural Committee, the number of wanders in 2018 was 146,773, which rose to 155,869 in 2020, an increase of 6.19 %, and increased to 159,697 in 2023. From this we can see that the number of stray dogs in Taiwan has been increasing, not only that, but even stray dog \u200b\u200battack incidents have increased year by year. From 39 in 2018 to 59 in 2022, it can be clearly seen that the stray dog \u200b\u200breally causes safety to society to society. Doubt. Therefore, we believe that it is the top priority to actively reduce the number of existing traffic dogs and the number of reproduction. \nSupporting measures:\nDue to the current problems of chipping in Taiwan, such as the unknown of pets to the owner, incomplete information, unprocessed chips, etc., this situation may cause pet dogs to become stray dogs when they are abandoned, so they become stray dogs, so they become stray dogs, so In order to cooperate with the purpose of the feeding area, that is, the number of current stray dogs must be reduced, and the generation of stray dogs must also be reduced from the source, which means that the pet chip is actually implemented and the integrity of the owner\'s data registration must be determined. \nAccording to Article 19 of the Animal Protection Law, the birth, obtained, transferred, lost, and death of pets shall register with the competent institutions and groups entrusted by the municipality, county (cities) or its entrusted by the municipality, county (city) The competent authority shall be identified with the registration of pets and shall be implanted in the chip. On the implanted chips, pets and owners\' information, which will be logged in to the government\'s pet management system, so that it will be able to prevent pets from finding the owner of the owner after the loss, and help clarify the owner\'s information. Then reduce the problem of malicious abandonment. Although this article is compulsory, if the owner is executed and repeatedly persuaded, it can be punished up to 250,000 yuan. However, up to 24%of the houses in practice still did not cast chips. Based on this, we believe that the ""pet test"" solution can be proposed as supporting measures for mandatory pet chips to improve the pet chip rate of pet chips with irregular sampling inspections.\u3000\u3000 \nThe implementation of pet tests, considering that human resources are limited, we believe that we can choose to check and publicize in specific periods and locations of the highly dense pet dogs, and conduct approach check for pet hospitals, breeding grounds, shelters and other places to increase efficiency to increase efficiency Essence However, in the procedure of the intercourse, it is necessary to follow the legitimate procedures of the law and pay attention to the principle of proportion. If the test or the test results are refused to accept the chip without justified reasons, a penalty will be punished.']"

We believe that raising penalties and strengthening ban is the last line of defense required to self -discipline; and encourages the public to report anonymous to prevent the offenders from escaping from the French Open. \n3. Strengthening the prevention of child smoke damage prevention: It is too late if the cigarette damage is controlled until the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school. At present, many people in the national high school will still illegally buy smoke products. They can't have much impact. I think that if the first grade of elementary school or even kindergarten has been promoted to make children know the disadvantage of smoking from an early age. In addition to kindergarten, family education is also an important part. It should be able to play a great role. \n4. Strengthen the banner of underage smokers and merchants selling smoke to minors: Even if the regulations have clearly regulated relevant laws such as the law of the rule of law, there are still many merchants (grocery stores) illegally trafficking to smoke sales due to interests. For minors, smoke products should be strengthened or prohibited from grocery stores. \n5. Improve the design of the smoking room: Effective smoking rooms should not make it a poisonous gas room. The design of the inlet exhaust port can solve the problem and avoid the problem of the second -hand smoke from the inside. Studies have shown that personnel enter and leave the smoking room.

When we met smoking on the road, we sucked second -hand smoke, but smokers did not pay for our health, so It should be charged to smoke tax (donation). \nReplace the damage caused by second -hand smoke with data and data, as shown below\nSecond -hand smoke has been classified as a first -class carcinogenic substance by the International Cancer Research Center (IARC). There are nearly 6 million smokers and 600,000 non -smokers worldwide in the world. There are about 24,000 in Taiwan who die from smoking each year, while 3,000 died in second -hand smoke. Each year, about 150,000 to 230,000 people suffered from second -hand smoke. On average, about 2 to 3 minutes. Other people smoke and suffer from disease. (Ministry of Health and Welfare)\nI believe that according to this data, you can know how much the dangers caused by smoke. In order to promote social health and reduce the use of popular smoke products, what way do you use to achieve this goal?\nTobacco duty is the most economical and effective way to reduce the use of tobacco, especially among youth and low -income groups. Increasing taxes will increase the price of tobacco by 10%, tobacco consumption in high -income countries will decrease by about 4%, and tobacco consumption in low -income and middle -income countries will decrease by about 5%. (Who)\nTaking Australia with the highest price of tobacco as an example, increasing tobacco taxes indeed help reduce the proportion of smoking population by more than half. ""Heavy tax"" is the best plan to effectively reduce the use of tobacco and encourage smoking quitting. (Businessfocus)\nIt can be displayed from the above two data. At present, the best way to reduce smoke products is to increase smoke tax. \nHow much does Taiwan\'s current smoke tax (donation) levy?\nFor the taxation part, the current levy price is NT $ 1,590 per thousand. \nThere is also a healthy welfare donation. The current levy price is NT $ 1,000 per thousand. (Ministry of Finance)\n\xa0 \nThe average smoke price in Taiwan in 2022 was 116 yuan (now healthy)\nSimple calculation, smoke tax+smoke donation+business tax (5%), 20 cigarettes per bag requires about 57.2 yuan tariffs, accounting for about 49.2%of the price of smoke products. Considering that imported cigarette products include tariffs, the actual ones are actually actual. The price will be slightly higher than this. According to the Now health release, the smoke tax accounts for about 53%.\nHow much is reasonable?\nThe World Health Organization recommends that the taxation share of tobacco retail prices is at least 75%(WHO)\nTaiwan\'s 53%compared to 75%of WHO, we can see that there is still a long way to go in Taiwan. \nAt the same time, with the price of smoke, Qiu Chenyuan, the party legislator of the people, said that Taiwan ’s GDP ranks 21st in the world, but the price of smoke is 123rd, which is lower than that of nearby countries such as South Korea and China. (Health Medical Network)\nTherefore, it is imperative to increase the smoking tax\nHow to increase it?\nLet\'s take a look at the current regulations of Taiwan\'s adjustment\nThe Tobacco Prevention Law wrote that the amount of health welfare donations, and the central authorities and the Ministry of Finance should invite scholars and experts in finance, economy, public health and related fields every two years to evaluate. \nHowever, the last time Taiwan\'s cigarette donation was traced back to 2009, and the smoke tax also increased only once in 2017. \nSo we need more active means to adjust the smoke tax\nAfter calculation, assuming that the profits of the smoke tax business are still unchanged, the 75%standard tobacco tax of WHO must be increased to 175.2 yuan (of course, the profits of the smoke merchants will be reduced, and the actual number will not be exactly the same)\nCompared with a large adjustment, the adjustment will be more secure and better year by year, and it will also give smoke addicts to quit smoking. \nThe author recommends setting the law (or administrative rules) to meet the ""\nBefore the price of tobacco taxes is at least 75%of the smoke, ""should increase no less than 20%year -on -year smoke (or smoke tax, choose space for the government here), or the total amount of tobacco donations+tobacco taxes should not be lower than 10 per year each year. %\n(Supplementary instructions: Tobacco tax and smoke donations are two different methods of receipt, such as adjusting one item of 20%, the total price adjustment may only be up and down)\nIn this way, it takes about 10 years to meet the WHO standard. \nSo we can\'t drag it anymore! We should start to increase the cigarette tax as soon as possible to achieve the goal of using less smoke products. \n(Supplementary instructions: the difference between smoking tax and smoke donation.

Everyone knows that the benefits of rent collection are far greater than the cost of holding, and then the land house rises. How can it fall? The land resources are the main cause of the gap between the rich and the poor. As long as the tax rate is increased significantly to limit the holdings, a small number of people can avoid a large number of land; The return to the public system allows everyone to quarrel on the interests of the land. \n1.

Definition of land hoarding: Whether it is re -planning or purchase of inheritance, the land -building open space, whether there are roads or parking lot gas stations, etc., must not be set up as field funds. Setting up the parking lot seems to be public welfare. When it is transferred to the landlord someday, is it not called hoarding during this period? It is better to reward the three -dimensional parking tower in the city plan. The non -self -occupation price tax is greatly improved, and the national tax supplements the military expenses to defend the country according to the national total progressive method. 3. Price increase to the public: the government takes care of the landlords, the land redevelopment changes, the farmland becomes industrial land, and the landlord does not want to violate the law for a long time. The land price of the country has soared but boring. 4. Legal use: Take a house with industrial land, take the agricultural land to build the factory. The use of illegal use of the land should be reported and disassembled. Including the industrial houses that become a collection of centralized houses into the company's shares, and the lease of the air defense and refuge where the air defense and shelter is leased. 5.

The impact of young childization is very serious and brings a lot of problems. We believe that this is related to parenting measures, so we decided to study it. \n1. The length of the holidays of infant leave is short. In Article 16 of the Equality Law of Gender Work, it is mentioned: ""After serving for six months, he must apply for a childcare for childcare to stop salary before each child is three years old. The baby\'s stay suspension must not exceed two years. Banning and childcare centers do not necessarily accept children of this age. If you do n’t get a child in the public young class, you can only stay at home. Who should the child take care of it? Some parents will resign and go home to take care of the child because of this problem, but this will make the family have too much burden on A certain extent affects the economic development of society. \nTherefore, we hope that the government can extend the period of childcare for childcare to children four years old, so as to avoid parents who need to leave because of their children. \n2. There is a problem of difficulty in reinstatement for re -salaries. Even if the regulations are stipulated, employers must not refuse the right to reinstate labor, but they do not say that they cannot adjust their positions. Many employees who ask for children who ask for children will have similar problems. When being transferred to other positions, being transferred to the branch for strange reasons, and being downgraded by no reason, etc., are common situations that will occur after salary. \nTherefore, we believe that the government should improve the clarification of laws and regulations, avoid allowing some companies to drill vulnerabilities and cause the burden on young parents. \n3. The quality of kindergarten teachers is uneven in Taiwan. A large number of kindergarten teachers have sexual assaults on children, or accidentally hurt their children. Children are hurt. If the rumored kindergarten feeding case a while ago, even if it was not said that it was caused by the kindergarten teacher in the end, it still saw that there is still a lot of room for improvement in the treatment of preschool education related affairs. The recent child abuse of children in Tao City, also found that many kindergartens will try to cover the facts. For example, do not show parents to the monitor, and use a few words to send bad behaviors such as parents. \nTherefore, we believe that the government should make the law clearer and send more people to intervene in such incidents to prevent re -occurrence. \n4. The low parenting allowance given by the government In accordance with the latest regulations of 2023, the government will subsidize the family of 5,000 yuan, while the second child is 6,000 yuan, the third child is 7,000 yuan, and so on. On average, raising a child will cost more than 20,000 yuan per month. The subsidy of 5,000 yuan is simply a good salary. \nTherefore, we believe that the government should modify the current policy and add riches and other regulations to indeed protect the rights of vulnerable ethnic groups.', ""Take various measures to increase Taiwan's fertility rate_The fertility rate in Taiwan is the lowest in the world.

Therefore, it is proposed that a clear legislation can protect the power of the citizens receiving the right information without infringing the freedom of the media, and provide the online platform connected by the audience and the NCC, so that the public can reflect the media based on the ability of media reading. Improper, this can also improve the efficiency of NCC processing business. \nThe following are the norms of three key suggestions:\nThe establishment of a network platform that connects to the NCC enables citizens to reflect the improper media in real time. And increase the number of NCC audit groups to meet the best efficiency of reviewing people and unified. And on the platform, there are also pages of public media complaints on public complaints. \n? If the advertisements of the media's marketing products are exaggerated, or the news title/content is suspected of being suspected of being verified, a penalty is 10-50,000 yuan, or a punishment of 1-3 weeks of suspension is given. \n? Reasonably restrict the scope of power use of entertainment media paparazzi, such as: follow the sneak shot. It violates the personal privacy guaranteed by the Constitution for collecting news materials. If the complaint and the censorship is the fact, the power to restrict its broadcast\n???????????????????\nThe democracy and freedom of the country are not limited by what they want. The freedom under legal restrictions is the freedom of truly respecting each other. The implementation of freedom without infringing the freedom of the other party is the democracy that the country should implement."", 'Suggestions of the three laws and television laws._Reason explanation\nThank you for your proposal. At present, there is a proposal for ""Prevention of Fake Information"". In the discussion, in order to increase the amount of negotiations, please use more to use it. Therefore, this case will not be submitted. \n\xa0 \nFirst of all, the focus of the proposal to prevent fake information is to recommend that the government adopts the three major directions of regulatory network platform operators to comply with self -discipline, regular evaluation of the management mechanism of the network platform, and prevention of fake information into the civil defense system. The main purpose of the recommendation of the three laws and television laws in the radio and television law is to prevent the reporting of non -reported or harmful news information, and the act of operating the media to violate the news ethics. What is the relationship between the prevention of the online fake information? \n\xa0 \nSecond: discuss it with other proposals through the article:\nhttps://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/446799F1-2D2C-406D-A32B-9165721633E4\nThank you for your proposal. 1. The freedom of the people\'s speech is ""maximized"" by the Constitution, and its meaning also means that if the ""Constitution Conservation Principles"" should be used if they must be restricted, the ""minimum administrative interference principle"" and ""judicial retention trial"" and ""judicial retention trial"" should be used. in principle"". Second, the media is a checks and balance force beyond the three powers of administration, legislation, and judicial power. The content of speech guaranteed by the Constitution includes the freedom of communication and communication. In the media broadcast content, the government shall not review the content of the media in any form and reasons, so it shall not be restricted or prohibited by the method and content of the news reporting and mining of news reports. Therefore, this case does not enter the discussion. \n\xa0 \nHere I ask the government: Use the name of freedom of speech to gradually hurt the speech and the behavior of democratic systems. Is this part of the democratic system? This is also the reason why the Republic of China needs the concept of ""defense -type democracy"" and the reasons for reviewing the law: the distribution of false messages and hate remarks confuses and differentiates the masses. Should the government think that the existing mechanism has achieved results? (Case in detail)\nhttps://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/201910160118.aspx\n\xa0 \nFreedom of democracy and speech does not mean that it can be infinitely outline. The content of media reports must not be reviewed in any form and reasons. Therefore, the news reporting and mining methods and content of the news reports are not allowed to be restricted or prohibited in accordance with the legal government. "" When the public\'s right to listen, the government should do something and handle it in accordance with the law, because this is definitely not part of the freedom of speech, and the scope of protection should not be applied. \n\xa0 \nFinally, I re -proposed the content:\nI. Communication Communication Business Network (defined as broadcast content) of the National Communications Commission website (defined) and third -party verification organization cooperation. After the public report notified the content of the program content, it will Location is marked with the words in facts). Those who are confirmed to be fake information must be removed and clarified the message within 24 hours, and the relevant units are notified to investigate. \n2. Standardize radio and television media and digital platforms, report news events, social issues, and characters. The media exposure rate needs to be consistent to prevent improper use of the media\'s operating volume and confusing issues.', ""Media reports are unrealistic, and those who are confirmed must be mandatory to play clarification messages. (Unlimited radio and television and flat media)_1. News media reports are not real messages, unlimited information and improper information (such as hate remarks, quoting controversy online articles or intention to create public opinion wind direction, affecting the public's perception of government policies (including epidemic prevention policies)). Applicable to the radio and television regulations for punishment, the radio and television media industry must be mandatory on the news media channel (and the network platform and (community) pages and videos) of its news media channels. Essence \n\xa0 \n2. Plane and radio and television news media, which belong to the online news platform (including community and video platform page). If there is a network message function, it is necessary to clearly indicate the management specifications of message management, regularly manage the content of the message, and clearly display the appeal (report) And cooperate with the functions such as deleting improper message mechanisms to protect the rights and interests of listeners. \n\xa0 \nThird, the same as above, the online news platform of plane and radio and television news media needs to clearly indicate the content and style of the report, such as the timely reports of the editorial, the main writing room comments, and the actual name of the author (reporter, critic) and the main responsible persons. If there are news reports, it is referenced to social platforms (such as Facebook and PTT) as malicious uses such as distribution and operation fake messages, after confirmation (including user reports, community platform operators, and government notifications of improper users), media industry must be necessary The self -notification of the online platform industry will quote the report of the real network articles, as well as the content of the news message area, and prevent the use of dispute reports as unscrupulous people and groups as a tool for distributing and manipulating fake information, as well as a tool for creating public opinion.""]"

\n法律必須跟上時代變遷，現在人們保持五代或四代（六等親就是涉及四代血親，也就是到曾祖父母）血親的家庭團結感的情況明顯減少 \n因為現在親戚之間的關係發生了急劇變化。 過去，幾代家庭成員聚在一起生活，親戚之間的交流也很活躍，但隨著時代的變化，許多超過4寸以上的家庭平時很少有往來 \n韓國（南韓）也發現了這個弊端可能會影響自己的生育率，所以製訂了一份《親屬間婚姻的禁止範圍及其效力相關研究》的報告，提出應該比現在大幅縮小禁止結婚的範圍，屬於近親結婚的範圍應從現行的8寸以內的血親縮小到4寸以內的血親 \n（南韓的寸數計算是跟台灣的親等計算一樣的，幾寸就是幾等親，例如6寸就是六等親，見https://www.thenewslens.com/article/128676與https://www.163.com/dy/article/F0IMCBE30523PU9R.html） \n但是台灣的生育率還比南韓低好嗎？（台灣的生育率在2021年輸給了南韓） \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States \n美國有31個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親（四等親）結婚；在亞利桑那州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在伊利諾州，如果兩人都為50歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在印第安納州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，則可以結婚；在緬因州，如果有遺傳諮詢師的遺傳諮詢證明，則可以結婚；在明尼蘇達州，只有某些情況允許結婚；在猶他州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者兩人都為55歲或以上且至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；美國沒有一個州禁止同性結婚，但是這些州有沒有開放同性的四等親結婚我就不清楚了，除了伊利諾州以外，伊利諾州對同性的四等親結婚是比照異性的四等親結婚處理的，儘管這個條件對同性婚姻沒有意義（所以我覺得台灣既然有開放同性結婚，且對於同性婚姻的近親結婚限制有放寬，那也可以跟這些州一樣，如果異性近親婚姻的兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，就比照同性近親婚姻處理，因為都一樣無法自然生育，所以都無須納入優生學） \n北卡羅來納州是比較特別的例子，一級堂表親（四等親）可以結婚，但是雙重一級堂表親（伯伯/叔叔跟阿姨的孩子，或者舅舅跟姑姑的孩子，為雙重四等親）則不能結婚 \n美國有2個州在某些情況允許叔侄（三等親）結婚，在紐約州，紐約上訴法院維持了一名婦女與其母親的半弟弟（同父異母或同母異父的弟弟）之間的婚姻，羅得島州雖然普遍禁止近親結婚，但例外允許符合猶太教教義的猶太人婚姻 \n美國有6個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親的孩子（五等親）結婚：肯塔基州、內華達州、俄亥俄州、猶他州、華盛頓州、威斯康辛州，但在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚 \n但是，美國沒有一個州禁止跟自己的二級堂表親（六等親）結婚，美國是典範的優生學國家，都有考慮到什麼年齡過大或者永久不育而無須納入優生學的問題了，如果二級堂表親（六等親）生下的孩子有遺傳疾病的機率也很高的話，美國早就有一些州禁止二級堂表親（六等親）結婚了

\n「近親結婚導致的遺傳疾病的發生與五等親（含）以上遺傳疾病的發生沒有直接的因果關係」，懂嗎？所以超過四等親就必須開放結婚，而且你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n在歐美的有開放同性婚姻的國家，同性婚姻的禁止近親結婚範圍都跟異性婚姻的禁止近親結婚的範圍一樣 \n這兩個是美國伊利諾州的例子：異性婚姻禁止到四等親結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲，但是同性婚姻也適用此規定，也就是說，同性的四等親仍然不能結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲

\n哈里斯說，在起草該法案時討論了表親條款，並故意留下來，因為他不希望那些從事同性結合的人比結婚的異性戀夫婦擁有更多的權利 \n他說，我們希望這個問題與民事結合有關，而不是表親是否應該結婚 \n哈里斯是大會首批公開的同性戀成員之一，並最終成為眾議院多數黨領袖，他長期以來一直以婚姻平等的倡導者而自豪 \n但是，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在一些州結婚，但在其他州不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？（這句話套用在我們東亞，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在日本、香港、馬來西亞結婚，但是在台灣、中國大陸、南韓不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？） \n這篇中國大陸的文章有講到英國的例子： \nhttps://www.getit01.com/p20171229821870321/ \n在英國不論是civil marriage（異性婚姻） 還是civil partnership（同性婚姻）都要求不能是近親 \n從明年開始英格蘭和威爾士將取消civil marriage作為一男一女結合這個說法，同性之間也可以作為civil marriage註冊，但是近親不允許結婚的條例未變 \n也就是說，這兩種同性婚姻關係都不得發生在近親之間

\n所以，結論是，台灣似乎是全世界唯一一個同性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍比異性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍小的國家（德國跟荷蘭似乎允許親生兄弟或親生姐妹結婚，但是不允許親生兄妹或親生姐弟結婚，所以可能是另一個例子，我還不太確定，另外確實有人支持開放親生兄弟或親生姐妹結婚，見https://www.mobile01.com/topicdetail.php?f=292&t=5238232的7樓留言），大法官啊…你們會通過同性婚姻的釋憲就表示你們比較開放，但是既然是那麼開放，為什麼還要禁止五等親六等親結婚？你們都不知道目前大部份的發達國家的作法是怎樣嗎？（https://www.getit01.com/p20171229821870321/這篇文章：「可是，咱們的發達國家，歐洲，基本也是一片藍呀……只有美國紅色部分比較多。」）你們不是說什麼都要學歐洲（例如同性婚姻共同收養子女，也就是收養與雙方都沒有血緣關係的子女，見https://equallove.tw/future/55）嗎？怎麼在四等親結婚的部份又不學了？雙標仔，真搞不懂你們的標準在哪裡，還有你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？還有你們就沒有想到中國大陸跟菲律賓限制到四等親、美國每個州限制到三等四等或五等親、日本英國法國瑞士香港紐西蘭限制到三等親嗎？（德國荷蘭澳門馬來西亞澳洲智利阿根廷只限制到二等親，不過連三等親都能結婚太誇張了）都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n和天主教及新教都不同，東正教會禁止遠至二級堂表親結婚。但根據賽普勒斯正教會最新（2010年）的憲章，禁止結婚的親屬關係最高只至五等親（也就是一級堂表親的子女），因此二級堂表親可以結婚 \n你們看，中國大陸的限制近親結婚範圍都比台灣小了（中國大陸限制到三代以內，等於是兩人有相同的祖父母，但是台灣限制到六等親，等於是兩人有相同的曾祖父母），他們都說他們才是異類了，見https://www.zhihu.com/question/29144942與https://ppfocus.com/0/hi2234654.html，那中國大陸說自己是異類，台灣豈不是更嚴重？ \n而且，他還說「中國之所以如此重視、也需要重視此問題，是因為龐大的人口基數。即使比一般情況只高幾個百分點，那也是幾千萬人。日本人口雖然也不少（相對於其面積），但其社會老齡化、少子化嚴重，所以是不太有可能修改這條法律的。 」，台灣的人口基數又不多，而且台灣的老齡化程度僅次於日本，且少子化程度又是世界第一，那照這個邏輯，台灣不是就得跟日本一樣開放「四等親」結婚了？

\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States \n美國有31個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親（四等親）結婚；在亞利桑那州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在伊利諾州，如果兩人都為50歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在印第安納州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，則可以結婚；在緬因州，如果有遺傳諮詢師的遺傳諮詢證明，則可以結婚；在明尼蘇達州，只有某些情況允許結婚；在猶他州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者兩人都為55歲或以上且至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；美國沒有一個州禁止同性結婚，但是這些州有沒有開放同性的四等親結婚我就不清楚了，除了伊利諾州以外，伊利諾州對同性的四等親結婚是比照異性的四等親結婚處理的，儘管這個條件對同性婚姻沒有意義（所以我覺得台灣既然有開放同性結婚，且對於同性婚姻的近親結婚限制有放寬，那也可以跟這些州一樣，如果異性近親婚姻的兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，就比照同性近親婚姻處理，因為都一樣無法自然生育，所以都無須納入優生學） \n北卡羅來納州是比較特別的例子，一級堂表親（四等親）可以結婚，但是雙重一級堂表親（伯伯/叔叔跟阿姨的孩子，或者舅舅跟姑姑的孩子，為雙重四等親）則不能結婚 \n美國有2個州在某些情況允許叔侄（三等親）結婚，在紐約州，紐約上訴法院維持了一名婦女與其母親的半弟弟（同父異母或同母異父的弟弟）之間的婚姻，羅得島州雖然普遍禁止近親結婚，但例外允許符合猶太教教義的猶太人婚姻 \n美國有6個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親的孩子（五等親）結婚：肯塔基州、內華達州、俄亥俄州、猶他州、華盛頓州、威斯康辛州，但在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚 \n但是，美國沒有一個州禁止跟自己的二級堂表親（六等親）結婚，美國是典範的優生學國家，都有考慮到什麼年齡過大或者永久不育而無須納入優生學的問題了，如果二級堂表親（六等親）生下的孩子有遺傳疾病的機率也很高的話，美國早就有一些州禁止二級堂表親（六等親）結婚了

\n「近親結婚導致的遺傳疾病的發生與五等親（含）以上遺傳疾病的發生沒有直接的因果關係」，懂嗎？所以超過四等親就必須開放結婚，而且你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n在歐美的有開放同性婚姻的國家，同性婚姻的禁止近親結婚範圍都跟異性婚姻的禁止近親結婚的範圍一樣 \n這兩個是美國伊利諾州的例子：異性婚姻禁止到四等親結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲，但是同性婚姻也適用此規定，也就是說，同性的四等親仍然不能結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲

\n哈里斯說，在起草該法案時討論了表親條款，並故意留下來，因為他不希望那些從事同性結合的人比結婚的異性戀夫婦擁有更多的權利 \n他說，我們希望這個問題與民事結合有關，而不是表親是否應該結婚 \n哈里斯是大會首批公開的同性戀成員之一，並最終成為眾議院多數黨領袖，他長期以來一直以婚姻平等的倡導者而自豪 \n但是，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在一些州結婚，但在其他州不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？（這句話套用在我們東亞，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在日本、香港、馬來西亞結婚，但是在台灣、中國大陸、南韓不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？） \n這篇中國大陸的文章有講到英國的例子： \nhttps://www.getit01.com/p20171229821870321/ \n在英國不論是civil marriage（異性婚姻） 還是civil partnership（同性婚姻）都要求不能是近親 \n從明年開始英格蘭和威爾士將取消civil marriage作為一男一女結合這個說法，同性之間也可以作為civil marriage註冊，但是近親不允許結婚的條例未變 \n也就是說，這兩種同性婚姻關係都不得發生在近親之間

\n所以，結論是，台灣似乎是全世界唯一一個同性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍比異性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍小的國家（德國跟荷蘭似乎允許親生兄弟或親生姐妹結婚，但是不允許親生兄妹或親生姐弟結婚，所以可能是另一個例子，我還不太確定，另外確實有人支持開放親生兄弟或親生姐妹結婚，見https://www.mobile01.com/topicdetail.php?f=292&t=5238232的7樓留言），大法官啊…你們會通過同性婚姻的釋憲就表示你們比較開放，但是既然是那麼開放，為什麼還要禁止五等親六等親結婚？你們都不知道目前大部份的發達國家的作法是怎樣嗎？（https://www.getit01.com/p20171229821870321/這篇文章：「可是，咱們的發達國家，歐洲，基本也是一片藍呀……只有美國紅色部分比較多。」）你們不是說什麼都要學歐洲（例如同性婚姻共同收養子女，也就是收養與雙方都沒有血緣關係的子女，見https://equallove.tw/future/55）嗎？怎麼在四等親結婚的部份又不學了？雙標仔，真搞不懂你們的標準在哪裡，還有你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？還有你們就沒有想到中國大陸跟菲律賓限制到四等親、美國每個州限制到三等四等或五等親、日本英國法國瑞士香港紐西蘭限制到三等親嗎？（德國荷蘭澳門馬來西亞澳洲智利阿根廷只限制到二等親，不過連三等親都能結婚太誇張了）都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n和天主教及新教都不同，東正教會禁止遠至二級堂表親結婚。但根據賽普勒斯正教會最新（2010年）的憲章，禁止結婚的親屬關係最高只至五等親（也就是一級堂表親的子女），因此二級堂表親可以結婚 \n你們看，中國大陸的限制近親結婚範圍都比台灣小了（中國大陸限制到三代以內，等於是兩人有相同的祖父母，但是台灣限制到六等親，等於是兩人有相同的曾祖父母），他們都說他們才是異類了，見https://www.zhihu.com/question/29144942與https://ppfocus.com/0/hi2234654.html，那中國大陸說自己是異類，台灣豈不是更嚴重？ \n而且，他還說「中國之所以如此重視、也需要重視此問題，是因為龐大的人口基數。即使比一般情況只高幾個百分點，那也是幾千萬人。日本人口雖然也不少（相對於其面積），但其社會老齡化、少子化嚴重，所以是不太有可能修改這條法律的。 」，台灣的人口基數又不多，而且台灣的老齡化程度僅次於日本，且少子化程度又是世界第一，那照這個邏輯，台灣不是就得跟日本一樣開放「四等親」結婚了？

\n中國大陸都知道「禁止患有醫學上認為不應當結婚的疾病的人結婚」了（全世界只有中國大陸有這個規定），就表示他們很怕小孩會患病、很懂優生，見https://kknews.cc/emotion/y2kzyvg.html與https://kknews.cc/emotion/nv6jm58.html與https://kknews.cc/emotion/ba6bxm9.html，但是，他們是允許同一個（外）曾祖父母（當然條件是要不同的（外）祖父母）的男女結婚的，見https://www.zhihu.com/column/p/32850479與https://www.getit01.com/p2018020132850479/與https://www.toutiao.com/article/6510067622472581640/與https://www.falvhao.com/261509.html與https://kknews.cc/emotion/2vyjboy.html與https://kknews.cc/society/oyyr9b6.html與https://kknews.cc/news/xjmy29.html與https://kknews.cc/emotion/4v5kgrv.html

\n美國有31個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親（四等親）結婚；在亞利桑那州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在伊利諾州，如果兩人都為50歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在印第安納州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，則可以結婚；在緬因州，如果有遺傳諮詢師的遺傳諮詢證明，則可以結婚；在明尼蘇達州，只有某些情況允許結婚；在猶他州，如果兩人都為65歲或以上，或者兩人都為55歲或以上且至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚；美國沒有一個州禁止同性結婚，但是這些州有沒有開放同性的四等親結婚我就不清楚了，除了伊利諾州以外，伊利諾州對同性的四等親結婚是比照異性的四等親結婚處理的，儘管這個條件對同性婚姻沒有意義（所以我覺得台灣既然有開放同性結婚，且對於同性婚姻的近親結婚限制有放寬，那也可以跟這些州一樣，如果異性近親婚姻的兩人都為65歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，就比照同性近親婚姻處理，因為都一樣無法自然生育，所以都無須納入優生學） \n北卡羅來納州是比較特別的例子，一級堂表親（四等親）可以結婚，但是雙重一級堂表親（伯伯/叔叔跟阿姨的孩子，或者舅舅跟姑姑的孩子，為雙重四等親）則不能結婚 \n美國有2個州在某些情況允許叔侄（三等親）結婚，在紐約州，紐約上訴法院維持了一名婦女與其母親的半弟弟（同父異母或同母異父的弟弟）之間的婚姻，羅得島州雖然普遍禁止近親結婚，但例外允許符合猶太教教義的猶太人婚姻 \n美國有6個州禁止跟自己的一級堂表親的孩子（五等親）結婚：肯塔基州、內華達州、俄亥俄州、猶他州、華盛頓州、威斯康辛州，但在威斯康辛州，如果女生為55歲或以上，或者至少有一方為永久不育，則可以結婚 \n但是，美國沒有一個州禁止跟自己的二級堂表親（六等親）結婚，美國是典範的優生學國家，都有考慮到什麼年齡過大或者永久不育而無須納入優生學的問題了，如果二級堂表親（六等親）生下的孩子有遺傳疾病的機率也很高的話，美國早就有一些州禁止二級堂表親（六等親）結婚了

\n「近親結婚導致的遺傳疾病的發生與五等親（含）以上遺傳疾病的發生沒有直接的因果關係」，懂嗎？所以超過四等親就必須開放結婚，而且你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n在歐美的有開放同性婚姻的國家，同性婚姻的禁止近親結婚範圍都跟異性婚姻的禁止近親結婚的範圍一樣 \n這兩個是美國伊利諾州的例子：異性婚姻禁止到四等親結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲，但是同性婚姻也適用此規定，也就是說，同性的四等親仍然不能結婚，除非他們當中有一方不孕或者有一方超過50歲 \nhttps://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Do-we-really-have-equality-if-some-cousins-can-t-17549437.php \nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/politics/how-to-marry-your-gay-cousin/1952413/ \n哈里斯說，在起草該法案時討論了表親條款，並故意留下來，因為他不希望那些從事同性結合的人比結婚的異性戀夫婦擁有更多的權利 \n他說，我們希望這個問題與民事結合有關，而不是表親是否應該結婚 \n哈里斯是大會首批公開的同性戀成員之一，並最終成為眾議院多數黨領袖，他長期以來一直以婚姻平等的倡導者而自豪 \n但是，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在一些州結婚，但在其他州不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？（這句話套用在我們東亞，如果表兄弟姐妹可以在日本、香港、馬來西亞結婚，但是在台灣、中國大陸、南韓不能結婚，我們真的有婚姻平等嗎？） \n這篇中國大陸的文章有講到英國的例子： \nhttps://www.getit01.com/p20171229821870321/ \n在英國不論是civil marriage（異性婚姻） 還是civil partnership（同性婚姻）都要求不能是近親 \n從明年開始英格蘭和威爾士將取消civil marriage作為一男一女結合這個說法，同性之間也可以作為civil marriage註冊，但是近親不允許結婚的條例未變 \n也就是說，這兩種同性婚姻關係都不得發生在近親之間 \nhttps://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/2794041 \nhttps://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article/category/161153/post/201902210015/ \nhttps://lawdb.tw/2023/02/02/同性婚姻要怎麼結婚？程序怎麼走？異國戀不能結/ \n所以，結論是，台灣似乎是全世界唯一一個同性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍比異性婚姻禁止近親結婚的範圍小的國家（德國似乎允許親生兄弟或親生姐妹結婚，但是不允許親生兄妹或親生姐弟結婚，所以可能是另一個例子，我還不太確定），大法官啊…你們會通過同性婚姻的釋憲就表示你們比較開放，但是既然是那麼開放，為什麼還要禁止五等親六等親結婚？你們都不知道目前大部份的發達國家的作法是怎樣嗎？你們不是說什麼都要學歐洲（例如同性婚姻共同收養子女，也就是收養與雙方都沒有血緣關係的子女，見https://equallove.tw/future/55）嗎？怎麼在四等親結婚的部份又不學了？雙標仔，真搞不懂你們的標準在哪裡，還有你們既然有想到同性婚姻無需納入優生學才開放同性的五等親六等親結婚，那你們就不知道優生學是限制到四等親最科學嗎？還有你們就沒有想到中國大陸跟菲律賓限制到四等親、美國每個州限制到三等四等或五等親、日本英國法國瑞士香港紐西蘭限制到三等親嗎？（德國荷蘭澳門馬來西亞澳洲智利阿根廷只限制到二等親，不過連三等親都能結婚太誇張了）都知道優生學了，還不知道優生學限制到四等親才是最科學的 \n和天主教及新教都不同，東正教會禁止遠至二級堂表親結婚。但根據賽普勒斯正教會最新（2010年）的憲章，禁止結婚的親屬關係最高只至五等親（也就是一級堂表親的子女），因此二級堂表親可以結婚 \n你們看，中國大陸的限制近親結婚範圍都比台灣小了（中國大陸限制到三代以內，等於是兩人有相同的祖父母，但是台灣限制到六等親，等於是兩人有相同的曾祖父母），他們都說他們才是異類了，見https://www.zhihu.com/question/29144942與https://ppfocus.com/0/hi2234654.html，那中國大陸說自己是異類，台灣豈不是更嚴重？ \n而且，他還說「中國之所以如此重視、也需要重視此問題，是因為龐大的人口基數。即使比一般情況只高幾個百分點，那也是幾千萬人。日本人口雖然也不少（相對於其面積），但其社會老齡化、少子化嚴重，所以是不太有可能修改這條法律的。 」，台灣的人口基數又不多，而且台灣的老齡化程度僅次於日本，且少子化程度又是世界第一，那照這個邏輯，台灣不是就得跟日本一樣開放「四等親」結婚了？

Who knows how hard the small shops operate? \nThe news has been mentioned in some stores to increase the price of the product. I believe that most stores will not casually want to increase the price and increase the price, because after all, it will lose their customers. \nThe truth is that because the store has been absorbing the price of raw materials on its own, it has been unbearable, and it is forced to increase the price. \nBut after the price increases, do the store really make money? No, the store has made less, because it has to sacrifice its profits to maintain the flow of people. Do so much, but make less earnings. \nAnd the average turnover of 200,000 will have to invoiced the threshold. It will not change due to the increase in the turnover of the store, but the decrease in profitability will change. The price increase is only the pressure of the store. \nIn particular, the government's adjustment of the basic salary part has risen for 13 consecutive years from the Republic of China from 1999 to the 112nd years of the Republic of China, which led to a significant increase in the cost of human resources for small merchants. What about salary?\nThe government policy is led by the whole body. Why is the level of business tax levy? \nIt is also like a delivery behavior in the past 10 years. The IRS will immediately think of the tax on the use of a bus -platform merchant, but none of the officials want to go to the proposal to change this for 37 years? \nSome people think that sales of 200,000 refers to the 200,000 monthly income of the store, and earn a lot more than the people's paid -class people. Why do they not have to invoiced? In addition to cognitive errors, they often do not see the expenses of small merchants. \nAfter deducting various costs and expenses, the profit of many small businesses is simply minimal and can only live a strong life. \nIf the increase in the increase in basic wages, the threshold for basic sales of 200,000 exemption invoicing should have increased to 850,000 yuan (calculated based on the basic monthly salary increase) or 680,000 yuan (according to the basic monthly salary increase) (according to the basic monthly salary increase) (according to the basic monthly salary increase) or 680,000 yuan (according to the basic monthly salary increase) (based Basic time -salary gain calculation). \nHowever, the main appeal in this article is not to improve such a high threshold, but to hope that the tax law can keep pace with the times. \nBecause of the rigidity of the tax law, the unfairness of the entire tax system has been miserable by the affected merchants. \nFinally, it is recommended that the government can also consider the business dilemma of small merchants when adjusting the basic salary of the people's salary people."", 'Unified the final end of various payment, comprehensively implement electronic invoices, ID card chip, combined with Taiwan lottery, stimulating normal domestic consumption cycle._\xa0 \xa0 \nUnified the final end of various payment, comprehensively implement electronic invoices, ID card chip, combined with Taiwan lottery, stimulating normal domestic consumption cycle.
